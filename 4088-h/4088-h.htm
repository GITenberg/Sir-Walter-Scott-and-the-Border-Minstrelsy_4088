<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Persons</span> not much interested in, or
cognisant of, &ldquo;antiquarian old womanries,&rdquo; as Sir
Walter called them, may ask &ldquo;what all the pother is
about,&rdquo; in this little tractate.&nbsp; On my side it is
&ldquo;about&rdquo; the veracity of Sir Walter Scott.&nbsp; He
has been suspected of helping to compose, and of issuing as a
genuine antique, a ballad, <i>Auld Maitland</i>.&nbsp; He also
wrote about the ballad, as a thing obtained from recitation, to
two friends and fellow-antiquaries.&nbsp; If to Scott&rsquo;s
knowledge it was a modern imitation, Sir Walter deliberately
lied.</p>
<p>He did not: he did obtain the whole ballad from Hogg, who got
it from recitation&mdash;as I believe, and try to prove, and as
Scott certainly believed.&nbsp; The facts in the case exist in
published works, and in manuscript letters of Ritson to Scott,
and Hogg to Scott, and in the original MS. of the song, with a
note by Hogg to Laidlaw.&nbsp; If we are interested in the truth
about the matter, we ought at least to read the very accessible
material before bringing charges against the Sheriff and the
Shepherd of Ettrick.</p>
<p>Whether <i>Auld Maitland</i> be a good or a bad ballad is not
part of the question.&nbsp; It was a favourite of mine in
childhood, and I agree with Scott in thinking that it has strong
dramatic situations.&nbsp; If it is a bad ballad, such as many
people could compose, then it is not by Sir Walter.</p>
<p>The <i>Ballad of Otterburne</i> is said to have been
constructed from Herd&rsquo;s version, tempered by Percy&rsquo;s
version, with additions from a modern imagination.&nbsp; We have
merely to read Professor Child&rsquo;s edition of
<i>Otterburne</i>, with Hogg&rsquo;s letter covering his MS. copy
of <i>Otterburne</i> from recitation, to see that this is a
wholly erroneous view of the matter.&nbsp; We have all the
materials for forming a judgment accessible to us in print, and
have no excuse for preferring our own conjectures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one now believes,&rdquo; it may be said, &ldquo;in
the aged persons who lived at the head of Ettrick,&rdquo; and
recited <i>Otterburne</i> to Hogg.&nbsp; Colonel Elliot
disbelieves, but he shows no signs of having read Hogg&rsquo;s
curious letter, in two parts, about these &ldquo;old
parties&rdquo;; a letter written on the day when Hogg, he says,
twice &ldquo;pumped their memories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I print this letter, and, if any one chooses to think that it
is a crafty fabrication, I can only say that its craft would have
beguiled myself as it beguiled Scott.</p>
<p>It is a common, cheap, and ignorant scepticism that
disbelieves in the existence, in Scott&rsquo;s day, or in ours,
of persons who know and can recite variants of our traditional
ballads.&nbsp; The strange song of <i>The Bitter Withy</i>,
unknown to Professor Child, was recovered from recitation but
lately, in several English counties.&nbsp; The ignoble lay of
<i>Johnny Johnston</i> has also been recovered: it is widely
diffused.&nbsp; I myself obtained a genuine version of <i>Where
Goudie rins</i>, through the kindness of Lady Mary Glyn; and a
friend of Lady Rosalind Northcote procured the low English
version of <i>Young Beichan</i>, or <i>Lord Bateman</i>, from an
old woman in a rural workhouse.&nbsp; In Shropshire my friend
Miss Burne, the president of the Folk-Lore Society, received from
Mr. Hubert Smith, in 1883, a very remarkable variant, undoubtedly
antique, of <i>The Wife of Usher&rsquo;s Well</i>. <a
name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a"
class="citation">[0a]</a>&nbsp; In 1896 Miss Backus found, in the
hills of Polk County, North Carolina, another variant,
intermediate between the Shropshire and the ordinary version. <a
name="citation0b"></a><a href="#footnote0b"
class="citation">[0b]</a></p>
<p>There are many other examples of this persistence of ballads
in the popular memory, even in our day, and only persons ignorant
of the facts can suppose that, a century ago, there were no
reciters at the head of Ettrick, and elsewhere in Scotland.&nbsp;
Not even now has the halfpenny newspaper wholly destroyed the
memories of traditional poetry and of traditional tales even in
the English-speaking parts of our islands, while in the Highlands
a rich harvest awaits the reapers.</p>
<p>I could not have produced the facts, about <i>Auld
Maitland</i> especially, and in some other cases, without the
kind and ungrudging aid, freely given to a stranger, of Mr.
William Macmath, whose knowledge of ballad-lore, and especially
of the ballad manuscripts at Abbotsford, is unrivalled.&nbsp; As
to <i>Auld Maitland</i>, Mr. T. F. Henderson, in his edition of
the <i>Minstrelsy</i> (Blackwood, 1892), also made due use of
Hogg&rsquo;s MS., and his edition is most valuable to every
student of Scott&rsquo;s method of editing, being based on the
Abbotsford MSS.&nbsp; Mr. Henderson suspects, more than I do, the
veracity of the Shepherd.</p>
<p>I am under obligations to Colonel Elliot&rsquo;s book, as it
has drawn my attention anew to <i>Auld Maitland</i>, a topic
which I had studied &ldquo;somewhat lazily,&rdquo; like Quintus
Smyrn&aelig;us.&nbsp; I supposed that there was an inconsistency
in two of Scott&rsquo;s accounts as to how he obtained the
ballad.&nbsp; As Colonel Elliot points out, there was no
inconsistency.&nbsp; Scott had two copies.&nbsp; One was
Hogg&rsquo;s MS.: the other was derived from the recitation of
Hogg&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>This trifle is addressed to lovers of Scott, of the Border,
and of ballads, <i>et non aultres</i>.</p>
<p>It is curious to see how facts make havoc of the conjectures
of the Higher Criticism in the case of <i>Auld
Maitland</i>.&nbsp; If Hogg was the forger of that ballad, I
asked, how did he know the traditions about Maitland and his
three sons, which we only know from poems of about 1576 in the
manuscripts of Sir Richard Maitland?&nbsp; These poems in 1802
were, as far as I am aware, still unpublished.</p>
<p>Colonel Elliot urged that Leyden would know the poems, and
must have known Hogg.&nbsp; From Leyden, then, Hogg would get the
information.&nbsp; In the text I have urged that Leyden did not
know Hogg.&nbsp; I am able now to prove that Hogg and Leyden
never met till after Laidlaw gave the manuscript of <i>Auld
Maitland</i> to Hogg.</p>
<p>The fact is given in the original manuscript of
Laidlaw&rsquo;s <i>Recollections of Sir Walter Scott</i> (among
the Laing MSS. in the library of the University of
Edinburgh).&nbsp; Carruthers, in publishing Laidlaw&rsquo;s
reminiscences, omitted the following passage.&nbsp; After Scott
had read <i>Auld Maitland</i> aloud to Leyden and Laird Laidlaw,
the three rode together to dine at Whitehope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near the Craigbents,&rdquo; says Laidlaw, &ldquo;Mr.
Scott and Leyden drew together in a close and seemingly private
conversation.&nbsp; I, of course, fell back.&nbsp; After a minute
or two, Leyden reined in his horse (a black horse that Mr.
Scott&rsquo;s servant used to ride) and let me come up.&nbsp;
&lsquo;This Hogg,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;writes verses, I
understand.&rsquo;&nbsp; I assured him that he wrote very
beautiful verses, and with great facility.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I
trust,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;that there is no fear of his
passing off any of his own upon Scott for old
ballads.&rsquo;&nbsp; I again assured him that he would never
think of such a thing; and neither would he at that period of his
life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let him beware of forgery,&rsquo; cried Leyden
with great force and energy, and in, I suppose, what Mr. Scott
used afterwards to call the <i>saw tones of his
voice</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This proves that Leyden had no personal knowledge of
&ldquo;this Hogg,&rdquo; and did not supply the shepherd with the
traditions about Auld Maitland.</p>
<p>Mr. W. J. Kennedy, of Hawick, pointed out to me this passage
in Laidlaw&rsquo;s <i>Recollections</i>, edited from the MS. by
Mr. James Sinton, as reprinted from the <i>Transactions</i> of
the Hawick Arch&aelig;ological Society, 1905.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>SCOTT
AND THE BALLADS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was through his collecting and
editing of <i>The Border Minstrelsy</i> that Sir Walter Scott
glided from law into literature.&nbsp; The history of the
conception and completion of his task, &ldquo;a labour of love
truly, if ever such there was,&rdquo; says Lockhart, is well
known, but the tale must be briefly told if we are to understand
the following essays in defence of Scott&rsquo;s literary
morality.</p>
<p>Late in 1799 Scott wrote to James Ballantyne, then a printer
in Kelso, &ldquo;I have been for years collecting Border
ballads,&rdquo; and he thought that he could put together
&ldquo;such a selection as might make a neat little volume, to
sell for four or five shillings.&rdquo;&nbsp; In December 1799
Scott received the office of Sheriff of Selkirkshire, or, as he
preferred to say, of Ettrick Forest.&nbsp; In the Forest, as was
natural, he found much of his materials.&nbsp; The people at the
head of Ettrick were still, says Hogg, <a
name="citation1a"></a><a href="#footnote1a"
class="citation">[1a]</a> like many of the Highlanders even now,
in that they cheered the long winter nights with the telling of
old tales; and some aged people still remembered, no doubt in a
defective and corrupted state, many old ballads.&nbsp; Some of
these, especially the ballads of Border raids and rescues, may
never even have been written down by the original authors.&nbsp;
The Borderers, says Lesley, Bishop of Ross, writing in 1578,
&ldquo;take much pleasure in their old music and chanted songs,
which they themselves compose, whether about the deeds of their
ancestors, or about ingenious raiding tricks and
stratagems.&rdquo; <a name="citation2a"></a><a href="#footnote2a"
class="citation">[2a]</a></p>
<p>The historical ballads about the deeds of their ancestors
would be far more romantic than scientifically accurate.&nbsp;
The verses, as they passed from mouth to mouth and from
generation to generation, would be in a constant state of flux
and change.&nbsp; When a man forgot a verse, he would make
something to take its place.&nbsp; A more or less appropriate
stanza from another ballad would slip in; or the reciter would
tell in prose the matter of which he forgot the versified
form.</p>
<p>Again, in the towns, street ballads on remarkable events, as
early at least as the age of Henry VIII., were written or
printed.&nbsp; Knox speaks of ballads on Queen Mary&rsquo;s four
Maries.&nbsp; Of these ballads only one is left, and it is a
libel.&nbsp; The hanging of a French apothecary of the Queen, and
a French waiting-maid, for child murder, has been transferred to
one of the Maries, or rather to an apocryphal Mary Hamilton, with
Darnley for her lover.&nbsp; Of this ballad twenty-eight
variants&mdash;and extremely various they are&mdash;were
collected by Professor Child in his <i>English and Scottish
Popular Ballads</i> (ten parts, 1882&ndash;1898).&nbsp; In one
mangled form or another such ballads would drift at last even to
Ettrick Forest.</p>
<p>A ballad may be found in a form which the first author could
scarcely recognise, dozens of hands, in various generations,
having been at work on it.&nbsp; At any period, especially in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the cheap press might print
a sheet of the ballads, edited and interpolated by the very
lowest of printer&rsquo;s hacks; that copy would circulate, be
lost, and become in turn a traditional source, though full of
modernisms.&nbsp; Or an educated person might make a written
copy, filling up gaps himself in late seventeenth or in
eighteenth century ballad style, and this might pass into the
memory of the children and servants of the house, and so to the
herds and to the farm lasses.&nbsp; I suspect that this process
may have occurred in the cases of <i>Auld Maitland</i> and of
<i>The Outlaw Murray</i>&mdash;&ldquo;these two bores&rdquo; Mr.
Child is said to have styled them.</p>
<p>When Allan Ramsay, about 1720, took up and printed a ballad,
he altered it if he pleased.&nbsp; More faithful to his texts
(wherever he got them), was David Herd, in his collection of
1776, but his version did not reach, as we shall see, old
reciters in Ettrick.&nbsp; If Scott found any traditional ballads
in Ettrick, as his collectors certainly did, they had passed
through the processes described.&nbsp; They needed re-editing of
some sort if they were to be intelligible, and readable with
pleasure.</p>
<p>In 1800, apparently, while Scott made only brief flying visits
from the little inn of Clovenfords, on Tweed, to his sheriffdom,
he found a coadjutor.&nbsp; Richard Heber, the wealthy and
luxurious antiquary and collector, looked into Constable&rsquo;s
first little bookselling shop, and saw a strange, poor young
student prowling among the books.&nbsp; This was John Leyden, son
of a shepherd in Roxburghshire, a lad living in extreme
poverty.</p>
<p>Leyden, in 1800, was making himself a savant.&nbsp; Heber
spoke with him, found that he was rich in ballad-lore, and
carried him to Scott.&nbsp; He was presently introduced into the
best society in Edinburgh (which would not happen in our time),
and a casual note of Scott&rsquo;s proves that he did not leave
Leyden in poverty.&nbsp; Early in 1802, Leyden got the promise of
an East Indian appointment, read medicine furiously, and sailed
for the East in the beginning of 1803.&nbsp; It does not appear
that Leyden went ballad-hunting in Ettrick before he rode thither
with Scott in the spring of 1802.&nbsp; He was busy with books,
with editorial work, and in aiding Scott in Edinburgh.&nbsp; It
was he who insisted that a small volume at five shillings was far
too narrow for the materials collected.</p>
<p>Scott also corresponded with the aged Percy, Bishop of
Dromore, editor of the <i>Reliques</i>, and with Joseph Ritson,
the precise collector, Percy&rsquo;s bitter foe.&nbsp;
Unfortunately the correspondence on ballads with Ritson, who died
in 1803, is but scanty; nor has most of the correspondence with
another student, George Ellis, been published.&nbsp; Even in Mr.
Douglas&rsquo;s edition of Scott&rsquo;s <i>Familiar Letters</i>,
the portion of an important letter of Hogg&rsquo;s which deals
with ballad-lore is omitted.&nbsp; I shall give the letter in
full.</p>
<p>In 1800&ndash;01, &ldquo;<i>The Minstrelsy</i> formed the
editor&rsquo;s chief occupation,&rdquo; says Lockhart; but later,
up to April 1801, the Forest and Liddesdale had yielded little
material.&nbsp; In fact, I do not know that Scott ever procured
much in Liddesdale, where he had no Hogg or Laidlaw always on the
spot, and in touch with the old people.&nbsp; It was in spring,
1802, that Scott first met his lifelong friend, William Laidlaw,
farmer in Blackhouse, on Douglasburn, in Yarrow.&nbsp; Laidlaw,
as is later proved completely, introduced Scott to Hogg, then a
very unsophisticated shepherd.&nbsp; &ldquo;Laidlaw,&rdquo; says
Lockhart, &ldquo;took care that Scott should see, without delay,
James Hogg.&rdquo; <a name="citation4a"></a><a href="#footnote4a"
class="citation">[4a]</a>&nbsp; These two men, Hogg and Laidlaw,
knowing the country people well, were Scott&rsquo;s chief sources
of recited balladry; and probably they sometimes improved, in
making their copies, the materials won from the failing memories
of the old.&nbsp; Thus Laidlaw, while tenant in Traquair Knowe,
obtained from recitation, <i>The D&aelig;mon Lover</i>.&nbsp;
Scott does not tell us whether or not he knew the fact that
Laidlaw wrote in stanza 6 (half of it traditional), stanza 12
(also a ballad formula), stanzas 17 and 18 (necessary to complete
the sense; the last two lines of 18 are purely and romantically
modern).</p>
<p>We shall later quote Hogg&rsquo;s account of his own dealings
with his raw materials from recitation.</p>
<p>In January 1802 Scott published the two first volumes of
<i>The Minstrelsy</i>.&nbsp; Lockhart describes the enthusiasm of
dukes, fine ladies, and antiquarians.&nbsp; In the end of April
1803 the third volume appeared, including ballads obtained
through Hogg and Laidlaw in spring 1802.&nbsp; Scott, by his
store of historic anecdote in his introductions and notes, by his
way of vivifying the past, and by his method of editing, revived,
but did not create, the interest in the romance of ballad
poetry.</p>
<p>It had always existed.&nbsp; We all know Sidney&rsquo;s words
on &ldquo;The Douglas and the Percy&rdquo;; Addison&rsquo;s on
folk-poetry; Mr. Pepys&rsquo; ballad collection; the ballads in
Tom Durfey&rsquo;s and other miscellanies; Allan Ramsay&rsquo;s
<i>Evergreen</i>; Bishop Percy&rsquo;s <i>Reliques of Ancient
Poetry</i>; Herd&rsquo;s ballad volumes of 1776; Evans&rsquo;
collections; Burns&rsquo; remakings of old songs; Ritson&rsquo;s
publications, and so forth.&nbsp; But the genius of Burns, while
it transfigured many old songs, was not often exercised on old
narrative ballads, and when Scott produced <i>The Minstrelsy</i>,
the taste for ballads was confined to amateurs of early
literature, and to country folk.</p>
<p>Sir Walter&rsquo;s method of editing, of presenting his
traditional materials, was literary, and, usually, not
scientific.&nbsp; A modern collector would publish
things&mdash;legends, ballads, or folk-tales&mdash;exactly as he
found them in old broadsides, or in MS. copies, or received them
from oral recitation.&nbsp; He would give the names and
residences and circumstances of the reciters or narrators (Herd,
in 1776, gave no such information).&nbsp; He would fill up no
gaps with his own inventions, would add no stanzas of his own,
and the circulation of his work would arrive at some two or three
hundred copies given away!</p>
<p>As Lockhart says, &ldquo;Scott&rsquo;s diligent zeal had put
him in possession of a variety of copies in various stages of
preservation, and to the task of selecting a standard text among
such a diversity of materials he brought a knowledge of old
manners and phraseology, and a manly simplicity of taste, such as
had never before been united in the person of a poetical
antiquary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lockhart speaks of &ldquo;The editor&rsquo;s conscientious
fidelity . . . which prevented the introduction of anything new,
and his pure taste in the balancing of discordant
recitations.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had already written that
&ldquo;Scott had, I firmly believe, interpolated hardly a line or
even an epithet of his own.&rdquo; <a name="citation8a"></a><a
href="#footnote8a" class="citation">[8a]</a></p>
<p>It is clear that Lockhart had not compared the texts in <i>The
Minstrelsy</i> with the mass of manuscript materials which are
still at Abbotsford.&nbsp; These, copied by the accurate Mr.
Macmath, have been published in the monumental collection of
<i>English and Scottish Popular Ballads</i>, in ten parts, by the
late Professor Child of Harvard, the greatest of scholars in
ballad-lore.&nbsp; From his book we often know exactly what kinds
of copies of ballads Scott possessed, and what alterations he
made in his copies.&nbsp; The <i>Ballad of Otterburne</i> is
especially instructive, as we shall see later.&nbsp; But of the
most famous of Border historical ballads, <i>Kinmont Willie</i>,
and its companion, <i>Jamie Telfer of the Fair Dodhead</i>, Scott
has left no original manuscript texts.&nbsp; Now into each of
these ballads Scott has written (if internal evidence be worth
anything) verses of his own; stanzas unmistakably marked by his
own spirit, energy, sense of romance, and, occasionally, by a
somewhat inflated rhetoric.&nbsp; On this point doubt is not
easy.&nbsp; When he met the names of his chief, Buccleuch, and of
his favourite ancestor, Wat of Warden, Scott did, in two cases,
for those heroes what, by his own confession, he did for
anecdotes that came in his way&mdash;he decked them out
&ldquo;with a cocked hat and a sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Walter knew perfectly well that he was not &ldquo;playing
the game&rdquo; in a truly scientific spirit.&nbsp; He explains
his ideas in his &ldquo;Essay on Popular Poetry&rdquo; as late as
1830.&nbsp; He mentions Joseph Ritson&rsquo;s &ldquo;extreme
attachment to the severity of truth,&rdquo; and his attacks on
Bishop Percy&rsquo;s purely literary treatment of the materials
of his <i>Reliques of Ancient Poetry</i> (1765).</p>
<p>As Scott says, &ldquo;by Percy words were altered, phrases
improved, and whole verses were inserted or omitted at
pleasure.&rdquo;&nbsp; Percy &ldquo;accommodated&rdquo; the
ballads &ldquo;with such emendations as might recommend them to
the modern taste.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ritson cried
&ldquo;forgery,&rdquo; but Percy, says Scott, had to win a
hearing from his age, and confessed (in general terms) to his
additions and decorations.</p>
<p>Scott then speaks reprovingly of Pinkerton&rsquo;s wholesale
fabrication of <i>entire ballads</i> (1783), a crime acknowledged
later by the culprit (1786).&nbsp; Scott applauds Ritson&rsquo;s
accuracy, but regrets his preference of the worst to the better
readings, as if their inferiority was a security for their being
genuine.&nbsp; Scott preferred the best, the most poetical
readings.</p>
<p>In 1830, Scott also wrote an essay on &ldquo;Imitations of the
Ancient Ballads,&rdquo; and spoke very leniently of imitations
passed off as authentic.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no small degree of
cant in the violent invectives with which impostors of this
nature have been assailed.&rdquo;&nbsp; As to <i>Hardyknute</i>,
the favourite poem of his infancy, &ldquo;the first that I ever
learned and the last that I shall forget,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;the public is surely more enriched by the contribution
than injured by the deception.&rdquo;&nbsp; Besides, he says, the
deception almost never deceives.</p>
<p>His method in <i>The Minstrelsy</i>, he writes, was &ldquo;to
imitate the plan and style of Bishop Percy, observing only more
strict fidelity concerning my originals.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is to
say, he avowedly made up texts out of a variety of copies, when
he had more copies than one.&nbsp; This is frequently
acknowledged by Scott; what he does not acknowledge is his own
occasional interpolation of stanzas.&nbsp; A good example is
<i>The Gay Gosshawk</i>.&nbsp; He had a MS. of his own &ldquo;of
some antiquity,&rdquo; a MS. of Mrs. Brown, a famous reciter and
collector of the eighteenth century; and the Abbotsford MSS. show
isolated stanzas from Hogg, and a copy from Will Laidlaw.&nbsp;
Mr. T. F. Henderson&rsquo;s notes <a name="citation10a"></a><a
href="#footnote10a" class="citation">[10a]</a> display the
methods of selection, combination, emendation, and possible
interpolation.</p>
<p>By these methods Scott composed &ldquo;a standard text,&rdquo;
now the classical text, of the ballads which he published.&nbsp;
Ballad lovers, who are not specialists, go to <i>The
Minstrelsy</i> for their favourite fare, and for historical
elucidation and anecdote.</p>
<p>Scott often mentions his sources of all kinds, such as MSS. of
Herd and Mrs. Brown; &ldquo;an old person&rdquo;; &ldquo;an old
woman at Kirkhill, West Lothian&rdquo;; &ldquo;an ostler at
Carlisle&rdquo;; Allan Ramsay&rsquo;s <i>Tea-Table
Miscellany</i>; Surtees of Mainsforth (these ballads are by
Surtees himself: Scott never suspected him); Caw&rsquo;s
<i>Hawick Museum</i> (1774); Ritson&rsquo;s copies, others from
Leyden; the Glenriddell MSS. (collected by the friend of Burns);
on several occasions copies from recitations procured by James
Hogg or Will Laidlaw, and possibly or probably each of these men
emended the copy he obtained; while Scott combined and emended
all in his published text.</p>
<p>Sometimes Scott gives no source at all, and in these cases
research finds variants in old broadsides, or elsewhere.</p>
<p>In thirteen cases he gives no source, or &ldquo;from
tradition,&rdquo; which is the same thing; though
&ldquo;tradition in Ettrick Forest&rdquo; may sometimes imply,
once certainly does, the intermediary Hogg, or Will Laidlaw.</p>
<p>We now understand Scott&rsquo;s methods as editor.&nbsp; They
are not scientific; they are literary.&nbsp; We also acknowledge
(on internal evidence) his interpolation of his own stanzas in
<i>Kinmont Willie</i> and <i>Jamie Telfer</i>, where he exalts
his chief and ancestor.&nbsp; We cannot do otherwise (as
scholars) than regret and condemn Scott&rsquo;s interpolations,
never confessed.&nbsp; As lovers of poetry we acknowledge that,
without Scott&rsquo;s interpolation, we could have no more of
<i>Kinmont Willie</i> than verses, &ldquo;much mangled by
reciters,&rdquo; as Scott says, of a ballad perhaps no more
poetical than <i>Jock o&rsquo; the Side</i>.&nbsp; Scott says
that &ldquo;some conjectural emendations have been absolutely
necessary to render it intelligible.&rdquo;&nbsp; As it is now
very intelligible, to say &ldquo;conjectural emendations&rdquo;
is a way of saying &ldquo;interpolations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But while thus confessing Scott&rsquo;s sins, I cannot believe
that he, like Pinkerton, palmed off on the world any ballad or
ballads of his own sole manufacture, or any ballad which he knew
to be forged.</p>
<p>The truth is that Scott was easily deceived by a modern
imitation, if he liked the poetry.&nbsp; Surtees hoaxed him not
only with <i>Barthram&rsquo;s Dirge</i> and <i>Anthony
Featherstonhaugh</i>, but with a long prose excerpt from a
non-existent manuscript about a phantom knight.&nbsp; Scott made
the plot of <i>Marmion</i> hinge on this myth, in the encounter
of Marmion with Wilfred as the phantasmal cavalier.&nbsp; He
tells us that in <i>The Flowers of the Forest</i> &ldquo;the
manner of the ancient minstrels is so happily imitated, that it
required the most positive evidence to convince the editor that
the song was of modern date.&rdquo;&nbsp; Really the author was
Miss Jane Elliot (1747&ndash;1805), daughter of Sir Gilbert
Elliot of Minto.&nbsp; Herd published a made-up copy in
1776.&nbsp; The tune, Scott says, is old, and he has heard an
imperfect verse of the original ballad&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I ride single on my saddle,<br />
For the flowers o&rsquo; the forest are a&rsquo; wede
awa&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>constant</i> use of double rhymes within the
line&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At e&rsquo;en, in the gloaming, nae
younkers are roaming,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>an artifice rare in genuine ballads, might alone have proved
to Scott that the poem of Miss Elliot is not popular and
ancient.</p>
<p>I have cleared my conscience by confessing Scott&rsquo;s
literary sins.&nbsp; His interpolations, elsewhere mere stopgaps,
are mainly to be found in <i>Kinmont Willie</i> and <i>Jamie
Telfer</i>.&nbsp; His duty was to say, in his preface to each
ballad, &ldquo;The editor has interpolated stanza&rdquo; so and
so; if he made up the last verses of <i>Kinmont Willie</i> from
the conclusion of a version of <i>Archie o&rsquo;
Ca&rsquo;field</i>, he should have said so; as he does
acknowledge two stopgap interpolations by Hogg in <i>Auld
Maitland</i>.&nbsp; But as to the conclusion of <i>Kinmont
Willie</i>, he did, we shall see, make confession.</p>
<p>Professor Kittredge, who edited Child&rsquo;s last part (X.),
says in his excellent abridged edition of Child (1905), &ldquo;It
was no doubt the feeling that the popular ballad is a fluid and
unstable thing that has prompted so many editors&mdash;among them
Sir Walter Scott, whom it is impossible to assail, however much
the scholarly conscience may disapprove&mdash;to deal freely with
the versions that came into their hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twenty-five years after the appearance of <i>The Border
Minstrelsy</i>, in 1827, appeared Motherwell&rsquo;s
<i>Minstrelsy</i>, <i>Ancient and Modern</i>.&nbsp; Motherwell
was in favour of scientific methods of editing.&nbsp; Given two
copies of a ballad, he says, &ldquo;perhaps they may not have a
single stanza which is mutual property, except certain
commonplaces which seem an integral portion of the original
mechanism of all our ancient ballads . . . &rdquo;&nbsp; By
selecting the most beautiful and striking passages from each
copy, and making those cohere, an editor, he says, may produce a
more perfect and ornate version than any that exists in
tradition.&nbsp; Of the originals &ldquo;the individuality
entirely disappears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Motherwell disapproved of this method, which, as a rule, is
Scott&rsquo;s, and, scientifically, the method is not
defensible.&nbsp; Thus, having three ballads of rescues, in
similar circumstances, with a river to ford, Scott confessedly
places that incident where he thinks it most &ldquo;poetically
appropriate&rdquo;; and in all probability, by a single touch, he
gives poetry in place of rough humour.&nbsp; Of all this
Motherwell disapproved. (See <i>Kinmont Willie</i>,
<i>infra.</i>)</p>
<p>Aytoun, in <i>The Ballads of Scotland</i>, thought Motherwell
hypercritical; and also, in his practice inconsistent with his
preaching.&nbsp; Aytoun observed, &ldquo;with much regret and not
a little indignation&rdquo; (1859), &ldquo;that later editors
insinuated a doubt as to the fidelity of Sir Walter&rsquo;s
rendering.&nbsp; My firm belief, resting on documentary evidence,
is that Scott was most scrupulous in adhering to the very letter
of his transcripts, whenever copies of ballads, previously taken
down, were submitted to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; As an example, Aytoun,
using a now lost MS. copy of about 1689&ndash;1702, of <i>The
Outlaw Murray</i>, says &ldquo;Sir Walter has given it throughout
just as he received it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet Scott&rsquo;s copy,
mainly from a lost Cockburn MS., contains a humorous passage on
Buccleuch which Child half suspects to be by Sir Walter himself.
<a name="citation15a"></a><a href="#footnote15a"
class="citation">[15a]</a>&nbsp; It is impossible for me to know
whether Child&rsquo;s hesitating conjecture is right or
wrong.&nbsp; Certainly we shall see, when Scott had but one MS.
copy, as of <i>Auld Maitland</i>, his editing left little or
nothing to be desired.</p>
<p>But now Scott is assailed, both where he deserves, and where,
in my opinion, he does not deserve censure.</p>
<p>Scott did no more than his confessed following of
Percy&rsquo;s method implies, to his original text of the
<i>Ballad of Otterburne</i>.&nbsp; This I shall prove from his
original text, published by Child from the Abbotsford MSS., and
by a letter from the collector of the ballad, the Ettrick
Shepherd.</p>
<p>The facts, in this instance, apparently are utterly unknown to
Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. Fitzwilliam Elliot, in his <i>Further
Essays on Border Ballads</i> (1910), pp. 1&ndash;45.</p>
<p>Again, I am absolutely certain, and can demonstrate, that
Scott did not (as Colonel Elliot believes) detect Hogg in forging
<i>Auld Maitland</i>, join with him in this fraud, and palm the
ballad off on the public.&nbsp; Nothing of the kind
occurred.&nbsp; Scott did not lie in this matter, both to the
world and to his intimate friends, in private letters.</p>
<p>Once more, without better evidence than we possess, I do not
believe that, in <i>Jamie Telfer</i>, Scott transferred the glory
from the Elliots to the Scotts, and the shame from Buccleuch to
Elliot of Stobs.&nbsp; The discussion leads us into very curious
matter.&nbsp; But here, with our present materials, neither
absolute proof nor disproof is possible.</p>
<p>Finally, as to <i>Kinmont Willie</i>, I merely give such
reasons as I can find for thinking that Scott <i>had</i>
&ldquo;mangled&rdquo; fragments of an old ballad before him, and
did not merely paraphrase the narrative of Walter Scott of
Satchells, in his doggerel <i>True History of the Name of
Scott</i> (1688).</p>
<p>The positions of Colonel Elliot are in each case the reverse
of mine.&nbsp; In the instance of <i>Auld Maitland</i> (where
Scott&rsquo;s conduct would be unpardonable if Colonel
Elliot&rsquo;s view were correct), I have absolute proof that he
is entirely mistaken.&nbsp; For <i>Otterburne</i> I am equally
fortunate; that is, I can show that Scott&rsquo;s part went no
further than &ldquo;the making of a standard text&rdquo; on his
avowed principles.&nbsp; For <i>Jamie Telfer</i>, having no
original manuscript, I admit <i>decorative</i> interpolations,
and for the rest, argue on internal evidence, no other being
accessible.&nbsp; For <i>Kinmont Willie</i>, I confess that the
poem, as it stands, is Scott&rsquo;s, but give reasons for
thinking that he had ballad fragments in his mind, if not on
paper.</p>
<p>It will be understood that Colonel Elliot does not, I
conceive, say that his charges are <i>proved</i>, but he thinks
that the evidence points to these conclusions.&nbsp; He
&ldquo;hopes that I will give reasons for my disbelief&rdquo; in
his theories; and &ldquo;hopes, though he cannot expect that they
will completely dispose of&rdquo; his views about <i>Jamie
Telfer</i>. <a name="citation17a"></a><a href="#footnote17a"
class="citation">[17a]</a></p>
<p>I give my reasons, though I entertain but slight hope of
convincing my courteous opponent.&nbsp; That is always a task
rather desperate.&nbsp; But the task leads me, in defence of a
great memory, into a countryside, and into old times on the
Border, which are so alluring that, like Socrates, I must follow
where the <i>logos</i> guides me.&nbsp; To one conclusion it
guides me, which startles myself, but I must follow the
<i>logos</i>, even against the verdict of Professor Child,
<i>notre ma&icirc;tre &agrave; tous</i>.&nbsp; In some instances,
I repeat, positive proof of the correctness of my views is
impossible; all that I can do is to show that Colonel
Elliot&rsquo;s contrary opinions also fall far short of
demonstration, or are demonstrably erroneous.</p>
<h2><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>AULD
MAITLAND</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ballad of <i>Auld Maitland</i>
holds in <i>The Border Minstrelsy</i> a place like that of the
<i>Doloneia</i>, or Tenth Book, in the <i>Iliad</i>.&nbsp; Every
professor of the Higher Criticism throws his stone at the
<i>Doloneia</i> in passing, and every ballad-editor does as much
to <i>Auld Maitland</i>.&nbsp; Professor Child excluded it from
his monumental collection of &ldquo;English and Scottish Popular
Ballads,&rdquo; fragments, and variants, for which Mr. Child and
his friends and helpers ransacked every attainable collection of
ballads in manuscript, and ballads in print, as they listened to
the last murmurings of ballad tradition from the lips of old or
young.</p>
<p>Mr. Child, says his friend and pupil, Professor Kittredge,
&ldquo;possessed a kind of instinct&rdquo; for distinguishing
what is genuine and traditional, or modern, or manipulated, or,
if I may say so, &ldquo;faked&rdquo; in a ballad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This instinct, trained by thirty years of study, had
become wonderfully swift in its operations, and almost
infallible.&nbsp; A forged or retouched piece could not escape
him for a moment: he detected the slightest jar in the ballad
ring.&rdquo; <a name="citation18a"></a><a href="#footnote18a"
class="citation">[18a]</a></p>
<p>But all old traditional ballads are masses of
&ldquo;retouches,&rdquo; made through centuries, by reciters,
copyists, editors, and so forth.&nbsp; Unluckily, Child never
gave in detail his reasons for rejecting that treasure of Sir
Walter&rsquo;s, <i>Auld Maitland</i>.&nbsp; Child excluded the
poem <i>sans phrase</i>.&nbsp; If he did this, like Falstaff
&ldquo;on instinct,&rdquo; one can only say that antiquarian
instincts are never infallible.&nbsp; We must apply our reason to
the problem, &ldquo;What is <i>Auld Maitland</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Elliot has taken this course.&nbsp; By far the most
blighting of the many charges made by Colonel Elliot against Sir
Walter Scott are concerned with the ballad of <i>Auld
Maitland</i>. <a name="citation19a"></a><a href="#footnote19a"
class="citation">[19a]</a>&nbsp; After stating that, in his
opinion, &ldquo;several stanzas&rdquo; of the ballad are by Sir
Walter himself, Colonel Elliot sums up his own ideas thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My view is that Hogg, in the first instance, tried to
palm off the ballad on Scott, and failed; and then Scott palmed
it off on the public, and succeeded . . . let us, as gentlemen
and honest judges, admit that the responsibility of the deception
rests rather on the laird (Scott) than on the herd&rdquo; (Hogg.)
<a name="citation19b"></a><a href="#footnote19b"
class="citation">[19b]</a></p>
<p>If Colonel Elliot&rsquo;s &ldquo;views&rdquo; were correct
(and it is absolutely erroneous), the guilt of &ldquo;the
laird&rdquo; would be great.&nbsp; Scott conspires with a
shepherd, a stranger, to palm off a forgery on the public.&nbsp;
Scott issues the forgery, and, what is worse, in a private letter
to a learned friend, he utters what I must borrow words for: he
utters &ldquo;cold and calculated falsehoods&rdquo; about the
manner in which, and the person from whom, he obtained what he
calls &ldquo;my first copy&rdquo; of the song.&nbsp; If Hogg and
Scott forged the poem, then when Scott told his tale of its
acquisition by himself from Laidlaw, Scott lied.</p>
<p>Colonel Elliot is ignorant of the facts in the case.&nbsp; He
gropes his way under the misleading light of a false date, and of
fragments torn from the context of a letter which, in its
complete form, has never till now been published.&nbsp; Where
positive and published information exists, it has not always come
within the range of the critic&rsquo;s researches; had it done
so, he would have taken the information into account, but he does
not.&nbsp; Of the existence of Scott&rsquo;s &ldquo;first
copy&rdquo; of the ballad in manuscript our critic seems never to
have heard; certainly he has not studied the MS.&nbsp; Had he
done so he would not assign (on grounds like those of Homeric
critics) this verse to Hogg and that to Scott.&nbsp; He would
know that Scott did not interpolate a single stanza; that
spelling, punctuation, and some slight verbal corrections, with
an admirable emendation, were the sum of his industry: that he
did not even excise two stanzas of, at earliest, eighteenth
century work.</p>
<p>I must now clear up misconceptions which have imposed
themselves on all critics of the ballad, on myself, for example,
no less than on Colonel Elliot: and must tell the whole story of
how the existence of the ballad first became known to
Scott&rsquo;s collector and friend, William Laidlaw, how he
procured the copy which he presented to Sir Walter, and how Sir
Walter obtained, from recitation, his &ldquo;second copy,&rdquo;
that which he printed in <i>The Minstrelsy</i> in 1803.</p>
<p>In 1801 Scott, who was collecting ballads, gave a list of
songs which he wanted to Mr. Andrew Mercer, of Selkirk.&nbsp;
Mercer knew young Will Laidlaw, farmer in Blackhouse on Yarrow,
where Hogg had been a shepherd for ten years.&nbsp; Laidlaw
applied for two ballads, one of them <i>The Outlaw Murray</i>, to
Hogg, then shepherding at Ettrick House, at the head of Ettrick,
above Thirlestane.&nbsp; Hogg replied on 20th July 1801.&nbsp; He
could get but a few verses of <i>The Outlaw</i> from his maternal
uncle, Will Laidlaw of Phawhope.&nbsp; He said that, from
traditions known to him, he could make good songs, &ldquo;but
without Mr. Scott&rsquo;s permission this would be an imposition,
neither could I undertake it without an order from him in his own
handwriting . . . &rdquo; <a name="citation21a"></a><a
href="#footnote21a" class="citation">[21a]</a>&nbsp; Laidlaw went
on trying to collect songs for Scott.&nbsp; We now take his own
account of <i>Auld Maitland</i> from a manuscript left by him. <a
name="citation21b"></a><a href="#footnote21b"
class="citation">[21b]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard from one of the servant girls, who had all the
turn and qualifications for a collector, of a ballad called
<i>Auld Maitland</i>, that a grandfather (maternal) of Hogg could
repeat, and she herself had several of the first stanzas, which I
took a note of, and have still the copy.&nbsp; This greatly
aroused my anxiety to procure the whole, for this was a ballad
not even hinted at by Mercer in his list of desiderata received
from Mr. Scott.&nbsp; I forthwith wrote to Hogg himself,
requesting him to endeavour to procure the whole ballad.&nbsp; In
a week or two I received his reply, containing <i>Auld
Maitland</i> exactly as he had received it from the recitation of
his uncle Will of Phawhope, corroborated by his mother, who both
said they learned it from their father, a still older Will of
Phawhope, and an old man called Andrew Muir, who had been servant
to the famous Mr. Boston, minister of Ettrick.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Concerning Laidlaw&rsquo;s evidence, Colonel Elliot says not a
word.</p>
<p>This copy of <i>Auld Maitland</i>, with the superscription
outside&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Mr.
William laidlaw</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Blackhouse</span>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>all in Hogg&rsquo;s hand, is now at Abbotsford.&nbsp; We next
have, through Carruthers using Laidlaw&rsquo;s manuscript, an
account of the arrival of Scott and Leyden at Blackhouse, of
Laidlaw&rsquo;s presentation of Hogg&rsquo;s manuscript, which
Scott read aloud, and of their surprise and delight.&nbsp; Scott
was excited, so that his <i>burr</i> became very perceptible. <a
name="citation23a"></a><a href="#footnote23a"
class="citation">[23a]</a></p>
<p>The time of year when Scott and Leyden visited Yarrow was not
the <i>autumn</i> vacation of 1802, as Lockhart erroneously
writes, <a name="citation23b"></a><a href="#footnote23b"
class="citation">[23b]</a> but the <i>spring</i> vacation of
1802.&nbsp; The spring vacation, Mr. Macmath informs me, ran from
11th March to 12th May in 1802.&nbsp; In May, apparently, Scott
having obtained the <i>Auld Maitland</i> MS. in the vernal
vacation of the Court of Session, gave his account of his
discovery to his friend Ellis (Lockhart does not date the letter,
but wrongly puts it after the return to Edinburgh in November
1802).</p>
<p>Scott wrote thus:&mdash;&ldquo;We&rdquo; (John Leyden and
himself) &ldquo;have just concluded an excursion of two or three
weeks through my jurisdiction of Selkirkshire, where, in defiance
of mountains, rivers, and bogs, damp and dry, we have penetrated
the very recesses of Ettrick Forest . . . I have . . . returned
<i>loaded</i> with the treasures of oral tradition.&nbsp; The
principal result of our inquiries has been a complete and perfect
copy of &ldquo;Maitland with his Auld Berd Graie,&rdquo; referred
to by [Gawain] Douglas in his <i>Palice of Honour</i> (1503),
along with John the Reef and other popular characters, and
celebrated in the poems from the Maitland MS.&rdquo;
(<i>circ.</i> 1575).&nbsp; You may guess the surprise of Leyden
and myself when this was presented to us, copied down from the
recitation of an old shepherd, by a country farmer . . . Many of
the old words are retained, which neither the reciter nor the
copyer understood.&nbsp; Such are the military engines, sowies,
<i>springwalls</i> (springalds), and many others . . . &rdquo; <a
name="citation24a"></a><a href="#footnote24a"
class="citation">[24a]</a></p>
<p>That Scott got the ballad in spring 1802 is easily
proved.&nbsp; On 10th April 1802, Joseph Ritson, the crabbed,
ill-tempered, but meticulously accurate scholar, who thought that
ballad-forging should be made a capital offence, wrote thus to
Scott:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the pleasure of enclosing my copy of a very
ancient poem, which appears to me to be the original of <i>The
Wee Wee Man</i>, and which I learn from Mr. Ellis you are
desirous to see.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Scott&rsquo;s letter to Ellis,
just quoted, he says: &ldquo;I have lately had from him&rdquo;
(Ritson) &ldquo;<i>a copie</i> of &lsquo;Ye litel wee man,&rsquo;
of which I think I can make some use.&nbsp; In return, I have
sent him a sight of <i>Auld Maitland</i>, the original MS . . . I
wish him to see it <i>in puris naturalibus</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The precaution here taken was very natural,&rdquo; says
Lockhart, considering Ritson&rsquo;s temper and hatred of
literary forgeries.&nbsp; Scott, when he wrote to Ellis, had
received Ritson&rsquo;s <i>The Wee Wee Man</i>
&ldquo;lately&rdquo;: it was sent to him by Ritson on 10th April
1802.&nbsp; Scott had already, when he wrote to Ellis, got
&ldquo;the original MS. of <i>Auld Maitland</i>&rdquo; (now in
Abbotsford Library).&nbsp; By 10th June 1802 Ritson wrote saying,
&ldquo;You may depend on my taking the utmost care of <i>Old
Maitland</i>, and returning it in health and safety.&nbsp; I
would not use the liberty of transcribing it into my manuscript
copy of Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s ballads, but if you will signify your
permission, I shall be highly gratified.&rdquo; <a
name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25"
class="citation">[25]</a> &ldquo;Your ancient and curious
ballad,&rdquo; he styles the piece.</p>
<p>Thus Scott had <i>Auld Maitland</i> in May 1802; he sent the
original MS. to Ritson; Ritson received it graciously; he had, on
10th April 1802, sent Scott another MS., <i>The Wee Wee Man</i>:
and when Scott wrote to Ellis about his surprise at getting
&ldquo;a complete and perfect copy of Maitland,&rdquo; he had but
lately received <i>The Wee Wee Man</i>, sent by Ritson on 10th
April 1802.&nbsp; He had made a spring, not an autumn, raid into
the Forest.</p>
<p>We now know the external history of the ballad.&nbsp; Laidlaw,
hearing his servant repeat some stanzas, asks Hogg for the full
copy, which Hogg sends with a pedigree from which he never
wavered.&nbsp; Auld Andrew Muir taught the song to Hogg&rsquo;s
mother and uncle.&nbsp; Hogg took it from his uncle&rsquo;s
recitation, and sent it, directed outside,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
Mr. William laidlaw</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Blackhouse</span>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and Laidlaw gave it to Scott, in March 12&ndash;May 12,
1802.&nbsp; But Scott, publishing the ballad in <i>The
Minstrelsy</i> (1803), says it is given &ldquo;as written down
from the recitation of the mother of Mr. James Hogg, who sings,
or rather chants, it with great animation&rdquo; (manifestly he
had heard the recitation which he describes).</p>
<p>It seems that Scott, before he wrote to Ellis in May 1802, had
misgivings about the ballad.&nbsp; Says Carruthers, he
&ldquo;made another visit to Blackhouse for the purpose of
getting Laidlaw as a guide to Ettrick,&rdquo; being
&ldquo;curious to see the poetical shepherd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laidlaw&rsquo;s MS., used by Carruthers, describes the wild
ride by the marshes at the head of the Loch of the Lowes, through
the bogs on the knees of the hills, down a footpath to
Ramseycleuch in Ettrick.&nbsp; They sent to Ettrick House for
Hogg; Scott was surprised and pleased with James&rsquo;s
appearance.&nbsp; They had a delightful evening: &ldquo;the
qualities of Hogg came out at every instant, and his unaffected
simplicity and fearless frankness both surprised and pleased the
Sheriff.&rdquo; <a name="citation26a"></a><a href="#footnote26a"
class="citation">[26a]</a>&nbsp; Next morning they visited Hogg
and his mother at her cottage, and Hogg tells how the old lady
recited <i>Auld Maitland</i>.&nbsp; Hogg gave the story in prose,
with great vivacity and humour, in his <i>Domestic Manners of Sir
Walter Scott</i> (1834).</p>
<p>In an earlier poetical address to Scott, congratulating him on
his elevation to the baronetcy (1818), the Shepherd
says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>When Maitland&rsquo;s song first met your ear,<br
/>
How the furled visage up did clear.<br />
Beaming delight! though now a shade<br />
Of doubt would darken into dread,<br />
That some unskilled presumptuous arm<br />
Had marred tradition&rsquo;s mighty charm.<br />
Scarce grew thy lurking dread the less,<br />
Till she, the ancient Minstreless,<br />
With fervid voice and kindling eye,<br />
And withered arms waving on high,<br />
Sung forth these words in eldritch shriek,<br />
While tears stood on thy nut-brown cheek:<br />
&ldquo;Na, we are nane o&rsquo; the lads o&rsquo; France,<br />
Nor e&rsquo;er pretend to be;<br />
We be three lads of fair Scotland,<br />
Auld Maitland&rsquo;s sons a&rsquo; three.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Stanza xliii. as printed.&nbsp; In Hogg&rsquo;s MS. copy,
given to Laidlaw there are two verbal differences, in lines 1 and
4.)</p>
<p>Then says Hogg&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Thy fist made all the table ring,<br />
By &mdash;, sir, but that is the thing!</p>

<p>Hogg could not thus describe the scene in addressing Scott
himself, in 1818, if his story were not true.&nbsp; It thus
follows that his mother knew the sixty-five stanzas of the ballad
by heart.&nbsp; Does any one believe that, as a woman of
seventy-two, she learned the poem to back Hogg&rsquo;s
hoax?&nbsp; That he wrote the poem, and caused her to learn it by
rote, so as to corroborate his imposture?</p>
<p>This is absurd.</p>
<p>But now comes the source of Colonel Elliot&rsquo;s theory of a
conspiracy between Scott and Hogg, to forge a ballad and issue
the forgery.&nbsp; Colonel Elliot knows scraps of a letter to
Hogg of 30th June 1802.&nbsp; He has read parts, not bearing on
the question, in Mr. Douglas&rsquo;s <i>Familiar Letters of Sir
Walter Scott</i> (vol. i. pp. 12&ndash;15), and another scrap, in
which Hogg says that &ldquo;I am surprised to hear that <i>Auld
Maitland</i> is suspected by some to be a modern
forgery.&rdquo;&nbsp; This part of Hogg&rsquo;s letter of 30th
June 1802 was published by Scott himself in the third volume of
<i>The Minstrelsy</i> (April 1803).</p>
<p>Not having the context of the letter, Colonel Elliot seems to
argue, &ldquo;Scott says he got his first copy in autumn
1802&rdquo; (Lockhart&rsquo;s mistake), &ldquo;yet here are Hogg
and Scott corresponding about the ballad long before autumn, in
June 1802.&nbsp; This is very suspicious.&rdquo;&nbsp; I give
what appears to be Colonel Elliot&rsquo;s line of reflection in
my own words.&nbsp; He decides that, as early as June 1802,
&ldquo;Hogg&rdquo;(in the Colonel&rsquo;s &lsquo;view&rsquo;),
&ldquo;in the first instance, tried to palm off the ballad on
Scott, and failed; and that then Scott palmed it off on the
public, and succeeded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is all a mare&rsquo;s nest.&nbsp; Scott, in March-May
1802, had the whole of the ballad except one stanza, which Hogg
sent to him on 30th June.</p>
<p>I now print, for the first time, the whole of Hogg&rsquo;s
letter of 30th June, with its shrewd criticism on ballads,
hitherto omitted, and I italicise the passage about <i>Auld
Maitland</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Ettrick House</span>, <i>June</i> 30.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have been
perusing your minstrelsy very diligently for a while past, and it
being the first book I ever perused which was written by a person
I had seen and conversed with, the consequence hath been to me a
most sensible pleasure; for in fact it is the remarks and modern
pieces that I have delighted most in, being as it were personally
acquainted with many of the modern pieces formerly.&nbsp; My
mother is actually a living miscellany of old songs.&nbsp; I
never believed that she had half so many until I came to a
trial.&nbsp; There are some (<i>sic</i>) in your collection of
which she hath not a part, and I should by this time had a great
number written for your amusement, thinking them all of great
antiquity and lost to posterity, had I not luckily lighted upon a
collection of songs in two volumes, published by I know not who,
in which I recognised about half-a-score of my mother&rsquo;s
best songs, almost word for word.&nbsp; No doubt I was piqued,
but it saved me much trouble, paper, and ink; for I am carefully
avoiding anything which I have seen or heard of being in print,
although I have no doubt that I shall err, being acquainted with
almost no collections of that sort, but I am not afraid that you
too will mistake.&nbsp; I am still at a loss with respect to
some: such as the Battle of Flodden beginning, &ldquo;From Spey
to the Border,&rdquo; a long poetical piece on the battle of
Bannockburn, I fear modern: The Battle of the Boyne, Young
Bateman&rsquo;s Ghost, all of which, and others which I cannot
mind, I could mostly recover for a few miles&rsquo; travel were I
certain they could be of any use concerning the above; and I
might have mentioned May Cohn and a duel between two friends,
Graham and Bewick, undoubtedly very old.&nbsp; You must give me
information in your answer.&nbsp; I have already scraped together
a considerable quantity&mdash;suspend your curiosity, Mr. Scott,
you will see them when I see you, of which I am as impatient as
you can be to see the songs for your life.&nbsp; But as I suppose
you have no personal acquaintance in this parish, it would be
presumption in me to expect that you will visit my cottage, but I
will attend you in any part of the Forest if you will send me
word.&nbsp; I am far from supposing that a person of your
discernment,&mdash;d&mdash;n it, I&rsquo;ll blot out that,
&rsquo;tis so like flattery.&nbsp; I say I don&rsquo;t think you
would despise a shepherd&rsquo;s &ldquo;humble cot an&rsquo;
hamely fare,&rdquo; as Burns hath it, yet though I would be
extremely proud of a visit, yet hang me if I would know what to
do wi&rsquo; ye.&nbsp; I am surprised to find that the songs in
your collection differ so widely from my mother&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Is
Mr. Herd&rsquo;s MS. genuine?&nbsp; I suspect it.&nbsp; Jamie
Telfer differs in many particulars.&nbsp; Johnny Armstrong of
Gilnockie is another song altogether.&nbsp; I have seen a verse
of my mother&rsquo;s way called Johny Armstrong&rsquo;s last
good-night cited in the <i>Spectator</i>, and another in
<i>Boswell&rsquo;s Journal</i>.&nbsp; It begins, &ldquo;Is there
ne&rsquo;er a man in fair Scotland?&rdquo;&nbsp; Do you know if
this is in print, Mr. Scott?&nbsp; In the Tale of Tomlin the
whole of the interlude about the horse and the hawk is a distinct
song altogether. <a name="citation30a"></a><a href="#footnote30a"
class="citation">[30a]</a>&nbsp; Clerk Saunders is nearly the
same with my mother&rsquo;s, until that stanza [xvi.] which ends,
&ldquo;was in the tower last night wi&rsquo; me,&rdquo; then with
another verse or two which are not in yours, ends Clerk
Saunders.&nbsp; All the rest of the song in your edition is
another song altogether, which my mother hath mostly likewise,
and I am persuaded from the change in the stile that she is
right, for it is scarce consistent with the forepart of the
ballad.&nbsp; I have made several additions and variations out,
to the printed songs, for your inspection, but only when they
could be inserted without disjointing the songs as they are at
present; to have written all the variations would scarcely be
possible, and I thought would embarrass you exceedingly.&nbsp;
<i>I have recovered another half verse of Old Maitlan</i>, <i>and
have rhymed it thus</i>&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Remember Fiery of the Scot</i><br />
<i>Hath cowr&rsquo;d aneath thy hand</i>;<br />
For ilka drap o&rsquo; Maitlen&rsquo;s blood<br />
I&rsquo;ll gie <i>thee</i> rigs o&rsquo; land.&mdash;</p>
<p><i>The two last lines only are original</i>; <i>you will
easily perceive that they occur in the very place where we
suspected a want</i>.&nbsp; <i>I am surprised to hear that this
song is suspected by some to be a modern forgery</i>; <i>this
will be best proved by most of the old people hereabouts having a
great part of it by heart</i>; many, indeed, are not aware of the
manners of this place, it is but lately emerged from barbarity,
and till this present age the poor illiterate people in these
glens knew of no other entertainment in the long winter nights
than in repeating and listening to these feats of their
ancestors, which I believe to be handed down inviolate from
father to son, for many generations, although no doubt, had a
copy been taken of them at the end of every fifty years, there
must have been some difference, which the repeaters would have
insensibly fallen into merely by the change of terms in that
period.&nbsp; I believe that it is thus that many very ancient
songs have been modernised, which yet to a connoisseur will bear
visible marks of antiquity.&nbsp; The Maitlen, for instance,
exclusive of its mode of description, is all composed of words,
which would mostly every one spell and pronounce in the very same
dialect that was spoken some centuries ago.</p>
<p>Pardon, my dear Sir, the freedom I have taken in addressing
you&mdash;it is my nature; and I could not resist the impulse of
writing to you any longer.&nbsp; Let me hear from you as soon as
this comes to your hand, and tell me when you will be in Ettrick
Forest, and suffer me to subscribe myself, Sir, your most humble
and affectionate servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">James

<p>In Scott&rsquo;s printed text of the ballad, two
interpolations, of two lines each, are acknowledged in
notes.&nbsp; They occur in stanzas vii., xlvi., and are
attributed to Hogg.&nbsp; In fact, Hogg sent one of them (vii.)
to Laidlaw in his manuscript.&nbsp; The other he sent to Scott on
30th June 1802.</p>
<p>Colonel Elliot, in the spirit of the Higher Criticism
(<i>chim&aelig;ra bombinans in vacuo</i>), writes, <a
name="citation31a"></a><a href="#footnote31a"
class="citation">[31a]</a> &ldquo;Few will doubt that the
footnotes&rdquo; (on these interpolations) &ldquo;were inserted
with the purpose of leading the public to think that Hogg made no
other interpolations; but I am afraid I must go further than this
and say that, since they were inserted on the editor&rsquo;s
responsibility, the intention must have been to make it appear as
if no other interpolations by any other hand had been
inserted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no other interpolations by another hand <i>were</i>
inserted!&nbsp; Some verbal emendations were made by Scott, but
he never put in a stanza or two lines of his own.</p>
<p>Colonel Elliot provides us with six pages of the Higher
Criticism.&nbsp; He knows how to distinguish between verses by
Hogg, and verses by Scott! <a name="citation32a"></a><a
href="#footnote32a" class="citation">[32a]</a>&nbsp; But, save
when Scott puts one line, a ballad formula, where Hogg has
another line, Scott makes no interpolations, and the ballad
formula he probably took, with other things of no more
importance, from Mrs. Hogg&rsquo;s recitation.&nbsp; Oh, Higher
Criticism!</p>
<p>I now print the ballad as Hogg sent it to Laidlaw, between
August 1801 and March 1802, in all probability.</p>

<p>At the end of his copy Hogg writes (probably of stanza
vii.)&mdash;&ldquo;You may insert the two following lines
anywhere you think it needs them, or substitute two
better&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>And marching south with curst Dunbar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A ready welcome found.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>II<br />
<i>WHAT IS AULD MAITLAND</i>?</h3>
<p>Is <i>Auld Maitland</i> a sheer forgery by Hogg, or is it in
any sense, and if so, in what sense, antique and
traditional?&nbsp; That Hogg made the whole of it is to me
incredible.&nbsp; He had told Laidlaw on 20th July 1801, that he
would make no ballads on traditions without Scott&rsquo;s
permission, written in Scott&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Moreover, how
could he have any traditions about &ldquo;Auld Maitland, his
noble Sonnis three,&rdquo; personages of the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries?&nbsp; Scott had read about them in poems of
about 1580, but these poems then lay in crabbed
manuscripts.&nbsp; Again, Hogg wrote in words (&ldquo;springs,
wall-stanes&rdquo;) of whose meaning he had no idea; he took it
as he heard it in recitation.&nbsp; Finally, the style is not
that of Hogg when he attempts the ballad.&nbsp; Scott observed
that &ldquo;this ballad, notwithstanding its present appearance,
has a claim to very high antiquity.&rdquo;&nbsp; The language,
except for a few technical terms, is modern, but what else could
it be if handed down orally?&nbsp; The language of undoubted
ballads is often more modern than that which was spoken in my
boyhood in Ettrick Forest.&nbsp; As Sir Walter Scott remarked, a
poem of 1570&ndash;1580, which he quotes from the Maitland MSS.,
&ldquo;would run as smoothly, and appear as modern, as any verse
in the ballad (with a few exceptions) if divested of its antique
spelling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now turn to the historical characters in the ballad.</p>
<p>Sir Richard Maitland of Lauder, or Thirlestane, says Scott,
was already in his lands, and making donations to the Church in
1249.&nbsp; If, in 1296, forty-seven years later, he held his
castle against Edward I., as in the ballad, he must have been a
man of, say, seventy-five.&nbsp; By about 1574 his descendant,
Sir Richard Maitland, was consoled for his family misfortunes
(his famous son, Lethington, having died after the long siege of
Edinburgh Castle, which he and Kirkcaldy of Grange held for Queen
Mary), by a poet who reminded him that his ancestor, in the
thirteenth century, lost all his sons&mdash;&ldquo;peerless
pearls&rdquo;&mdash;save one, &ldquo;Burdallane.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Sir Richard of 1575 has also one son left (John, the minister of
James VI.). <a name="citation41a"></a><a href="#footnote41a"

<p>From this evidence, in 1802 in MS. unpublished, and from other
Maitland MSS., we learn that, in the sixteenth century, the Auld
Maitland of the ballad was an eminent character in the legends of
that period, and in the ballads of the people. <a
name="citation41b"></a><a href="#footnote41b"
class="citation">[41b]</a>&nbsp; His</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobill sonnis three,<br />
Ar sung in monie far countrie,<br />
<i>Albeit in rural rhyme</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pinkerton published, in 1786, none of the pieces to which
Scott refers in his extracts from the Maitland MSS.&nbsp; How,
then, did Hogg, if Hogg forged the ballad, know of Maitland and
his &ldquo;three noble sons&rdquo;?&nbsp; Except Colonel Elliot,
to whose explanation we return, I am not aware that any critic
has tried to answer this question.</p>
<p>It seems to me that if the <i>Ballad of Otterburne</i>, extant
in 1550 in England, survived in Scottish memory till Herd&rsquo;s
fragment appeared in 1776, a tradition of Maitland, who was
popular in the ballads of 1575, and known to Gawain Douglas
seventy years earlier, may also have persisted.&nbsp; There is no
impossibility.</p>
<p>Looking next at Scott&rsquo;s <i>Auld Maitland</i> the story
is that King Edward I. reigned for fifty years.&nbsp; He had a
nephew Edward (an apocryphal person: such figures are common in
ballads), who wished to take part in the invasion of
Scotland.&nbsp; The English are repulsed by old Maitland from his
&ldquo;darksome house&rdquo; on the Leader.&nbsp; The English,
however, (stanza xv.) conquer Scotland, and join Edward I. in
France.&nbsp; They besiege that town,</p>
<blockquote><p>Which some call Billop-Grace (xviii.).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Maitland&rsquo;s three sons are learning at school, as
Scots often were educated in France.&nbsp; They see that
Edward&rsquo;s standard quarters the arms of France, and infer
that he has conquered their country.&nbsp; They &ldquo;will try
some jeopardy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Persuading the English that they are
themselves Englishmen, they ask leave to carry the royal
flag.&nbsp; The eldest is told that he is singularly like Auld
Maitland.&nbsp; In anger he stabs the standard-bearer, seizes the
flag, and, with his brothers, spurs to Billop-Grace, where the
French captain receives them.&nbsp; There is fighting at the
gate.&nbsp; The King says that three disguised lads of France
have stolen his flag.&nbsp; The Maitlands apparently heard of
this; the youngest goes to Edward, and explains that they are
Maitland&rsquo;s sons, and Scots; they challenge any three
Englishmen; a thing in the manner of the period.&nbsp; The three
Scots are victorious.&nbsp; Young Edward then challenges one of
the dauntless three, who slays him.&nbsp; Edward wishes himself
home at London Tower.</p>
<p>Such is the story.&nbsp; It is out of the regular line of
ballad narrative, but it does not follow that, in the sixteenth
century, some such tale was not told &ldquo;in rural rhyme&rdquo;
about Maitland&rsquo;s &ldquo;three noble sons.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
it is not historically true is nothing, of course, and that it is
not in the Scots of the thirteenth century is nothing.</p>
<p>Colonel Elliot asks, What in the ballad raised suspicion of
forgery (in 1802&ndash;03)?&nbsp; The historical inaccuracies are
common to all historical ballads.&nbsp; (In an English ballad
known to me of 1578, Henry Darnley is &ldquo;hanged on a
tree&rdquo;!)</p>
<p>Next, &ldquo;there are occasional lines, and even stanzas,
which jar in style to such a degree that they must have been
written by two separate hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this, also, is a common feature.&nbsp; In &ldquo;Professor
Child and the Ballad,&rdquo; Mr. W. M. Hart gives a list of
Professor Child&rsquo;s notes on the multiplicity of hands, which
he, and every critic, detect in some ballads with a genuinely
antique substratum. <a name="citation44a"></a><a
href="#footnote44a" class="citation">[44a]</a></p>
<p>Colonel Elliot quotes, as in his opinion the best, stanzas
viii., ix., x., xi., while he thinks xv., xviii. the worst.&nbsp;
I give these stanzas&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">VIII.</p>
<p class="poetry">They lighted on the banks o&rsquo; Tweed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And blew their coals sae het,<br />
And fired the Merse and Teviotdale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All in an evening late.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">IX.</p>
<p class="poetry">As they fared up o&rsquo;er Lammermoor,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They burned baith up and doun,<br />
Until they came to a darksome house,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some call it Leader Town.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">X.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Wha hauds this house?&rdquo; young
Edward cried,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Or wha gi&rsquo;est ower to me?&rdquo;<br />
A grey-hair&rsquo;d knight set up his head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And crackit right crousely:</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">XI.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Of Scotland&rsquo;s king I haud my
house,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He pays me meat and fee;<br />
And I will keep my guid auld house,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While my house will keep me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br />
I cannot, I admit, find any fault with these stanzas: cannot see
any reason why they should not be traditional.</p>
<p>Then Colonel Elliot cites, as the worst&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry"><br />
XV.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then fifteen barks, all gaily good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Met them upon a day,<br />
Which they did lade with as much spoil<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As they could take away.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">XVIII.</p>
<p class="poetry">Until we came unto that town<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which some call Billop-Grace;<br />
There were Auld Maitland&rsquo;s sons, a&rsquo; three,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning at school, alas!</p>
<p>Now, if I venture to differ from Colonel Elliot here, I may
plead that I am practised in the art of ballad-faking, and can
produce high testimonials of skill!&nbsp; To me stanzas xv.,
xviii. seem to differ much from viii.&ndash;xi., but not in such
a way as Hogg would have differed, had he made them.&nbsp;
Hogg&rsquo;s error would have lain, as Scott&rsquo;s did, in
being, as Scott said of Mrs. Hemans, <i>too poetical</i>.</p>
<p>Neither Hogg nor Scott, I think, was crafty enough to imitate
the prosaic drawl of the printed broadside ballad, or the feeble
interpolations with which the &ldquo;gangrel scrape-gut,&rdquo;
or <i>b&auml;nkels&auml;nger</i>, supplied gaps in his
memory.&nbsp; The modern complete ballad-faker <i>would</i>
introduce such abject verses, but Scott and Hogg desired to
decorate, not to debase, ballads with which they intermeddled,
and we track them by their modern romantic touch when they
interpolate.&nbsp; I take it, for this reason, that Hogg did not
write stanzas xv., xviii.&nbsp; It was hardly in nature for Hogg,
if he knew Ville de Grace in Normandy (a thing not very
probable), to invent &ldquo;Billop-Grace&rdquo; as a popular
corruption of the name&mdash;and a popular corruption it is, I
think.&nbsp; Probably the original maker of this stanza wrote, in
line 4, &ldquo;alace,&rdquo; an old spelling&mdash;not
&ldquo;alas&rdquo;&mdash;to rhyme with &ldquo;grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Elliot then assigns xv., xviii. as most likely of all
to be by Hogg.&nbsp; On that I have given my opinion, with my
reasons.</p>
<p>These verses, with xviii., lead us to France, and whereas
Scott here suspects that some verses have been lost (see his note
to stanza xviii.), Colonel Elliot suspects that the stanzas
relating to France have been interpolated.&nbsp; But the French
scenes occupy the whole poem from xvi. to lxv., the end.</p>
<p>What, if Hogg were the forger, were his sources?&nbsp; He
<i>may</i> have known Douglas&rsquo;s <i>Palice of Honour</i>,
which, of course, existed in print, with its mention of
Maitland&rsquo;s grey beard.&nbsp; But how did he know
Maitland&rsquo;s &ldquo;three noble sons,&rdquo; in
1801&ndash;1802, lying unsunned in the Maitland MSS.?</p>
<p>This is a point which critics of <i>Auld Maitland</i>
studiously ignore, yet it is the essential point.&nbsp; How did
the Shepherd know about the three young Maitlands, whose
existence, in legend, is only revealed to us through a manuscript
unpublished in 1802?&nbsp; Colonel Elliot does not evade the
point.&nbsp; &ldquo;We may be sure,&rdquo; he says, that Leyden,
before 1802, knew Hogg, and Hogg might have obtained from him
sufficient information to enable him to compose the ballad. <a
name="citation47a"></a><a href="#footnote47a"
class="citation">[47a]</a>&nbsp; But it was from Laidlaw, not
from Leyden, that Scott, after receiving his first copy at
Blackhouse, in spring 1802, obtained Hogg&rsquo;s address. <a
name="citation47b"></a><a href="#footnote47b"
class="citation">[47b]</a>&nbsp; There is no hint that before
spring 1802 Leyden ever saw Hogg.&nbsp; Had he known him, and his
ballad-lore, he would have brought him and Scott together.&nbsp;
In 1801&ndash;02, Leyden was very busy in Edinburgh helping Scott
to edit <i>Sir Tristram</i>, copying <i>Arthour</i>, seeking for
an East India appointment, and going into society.&nbsp;
Scott&rsquo;s letters prove all this. <a
name="citation47c"></a><a href="#footnote47c"
class="citation">[47c]</a></p>
<p>That Hogg, in 1802, was very capable of writing a ballad, I
admit; also that, through Blind Harry&rsquo;s <i>Wallace</i>, he
may have known all about &ldquo;sowies,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;portculize,&rdquo; and <i>springwalls</i>, or
<i>springald&rsquo;s</i>, or <i>springalls</i>, medi&aelig;val
<i>balistas</i> for throwing heavy stones and darts.&nbsp; But
Hogg did not know or guess what a <i>springwall</i> was.&nbsp; In
his stanza xiii. (in the MS. given to Laidlaw), Hogg
wrote&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>With springs; wall stanes, and good o&rsquo;ern<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them fast he threw.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scott saw the real meaning of this nonsense, and
read&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>With springalds, stones, and gads o&rsquo;
airn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his preface he says that many words in the ballad,
&ldquo;which the reciters have retained without understanding
them, still preserve traces of their antiquity.&rdquo;&nbsp; For
instance, <i>springalls</i>, corruptedly pronounced
<i>springwalls</i>.&nbsp; Hogg, hearing the pronunciation, and
not understanding, wrote, &ldquo;with springs: wall
stanes.&rdquo;&nbsp; A leader would not throw &ldquo;wall
stanes&rdquo; till he had exhausted his ammunition.&nbsp; Hogg
heard &ldquo;with springwalls stones, he threw,&rdquo; and wrote
it, &ldquo;with springs: wall stones he threw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hogg could not know of Auld Maitland &ldquo;and his three
noble sons&rdquo; except through an informant familiar with the
Maitland MSS. in Edinburgh University Library.&nbsp; On the
theory of a conspiracy to forge, Scott taught him, but that
theory is crushed.</p>
<p>Hogg says, in <i>Domestic Manners of Sir Walter Scott</i>,
that when his mother met Scott she told him that her brother and
she learned the ballad from auld Andrew Muir, and he from
&ldquo;auld Babby Mettlin,&rdquo; housekeeper of the first
(&ldquo;Anderson&rdquo;) laird of Tushielaw.&nbsp; This first
Anderson, laird of Tushielaw, reigned from 1688 to 1721 (?) or
1724. <a name="citation48a"></a><a href="#footnote48a"
class="citation">[48a]</a>&nbsp; Hogg&rsquo;s mother was born in
1730, and was only one remove&mdash;filled up by Andrew
Muir&mdash;from Babby, who was &ldquo;ither than a gude
yin,&rdquo; and knew many songs.&nbsp; Does any one think Hogg
crafty enough to have invented Babby Maitland as the source of a
song about the Maitlands, and to have introduced her into his
narrative in 1834?&nbsp; I conjecture that this Maitland woman
knew a Maitland song, modernised in time, and perhaps copied out
and emended by one of the Maitland family, possibly one of the
descendants of Lethington.&nbsp; We know that, under James I.,
about 1620, Lethington&rsquo;s impoverished son, James, had
several children; and that Lauderdale was still supporting them
(or <i>their</i> children) during the Restoration.&nbsp; Only a
century before, ballads on the Maitlands had certainly been
popular, and there is nothing impossible in the suggestion that
one such ballad survived in the Lauderdale or Lethington family,
and came through Babby Maitland to Andrew Muir, then to
Hogg&rsquo;s mother, to Hogg, and to Scott.</p>
<p>If a manuscript copy ever existed, and was Babby&rsquo;s
ultimate source, it would be of the late seventeenth
century.&nbsp; That is the ascertained date of the oldest known
MS. of <i>The Outlaw Murray</i>, as is proved from an allusion in
a note appended to a copy, referring to a Judge of Session, Lord
Philiphaugh, as then alive.&nbsp; The copy was of
1689&ndash;1702. <a name="citation49a"></a><a href="#footnote49a"
class="citation">[49a]</a></p>
<p>Granting a MS. of <i>Auld Maitland</i> existing in any branch
of the Maitland family in 1680&ndash;1700, Babby Mettlin&rsquo;s
knowledge of the ballad, and its few modernisms, are
explained.</p>
<p>As Lockhart truly says, Hogg &ldquo;was the most extraordinary
man that ever wore the maud of a shepherd.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had
none of Burns&rsquo; education.&nbsp; In 1802 he was young, and
ignorant of cities, and always was innocent of research in the
crabbed MSS. of the sixteenth century.&nbsp; Yet he gets at
legendary persons known to us only through these MSS.&nbsp; He
makes a ballad named <i>Auld Maitland</i> about them.&nbsp;
Through him a farm-lass at Blackhouse acquires some stanzas which
Laidlaw copies.&nbsp; In a fortnight Hogg sends Laidlaw the whole
ballad, with the pedigree&mdash;his uncle, his mother, their
father, and old Andrew Muir, servant to the famous Rev. Mr.
Boston of Ettrick.&nbsp; The copy takes in Scott and
Leyden.&nbsp; Later, Ritson makes no objection.&nbsp; Mrs. Hogg
recites it to Scott, and, according to Hogg, gives a casual
&ldquo;auld Babby Maitland&rdquo; as the original source.</p>
<p>Is the whole fraud conceivable?&nbsp; Hogg, we must believe,
puts in two stanzas (xv., xviii.), of the lowliest order of
printed stall-copy or &ldquo;gangrel scrape-gut&rdquo; style, and
the same with intent to deceive.&nbsp; He introduces
&ldquo;Billop-Grace&rdquo; as a deceptive popular corruption of
<i>Ville de Grace</i>.&nbsp; This is far beyond any craft that I
have found in the most artful modern &ldquo;fakers.&rdquo;&nbsp;
One stanza (xlix.)&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>But Ethert Lunn, a baited bear,<br />
Had many battles seen&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>seems to me very recent, whoever made it.&nbsp; Scott, in
lxii., gives a variant of &ldquo;some reciters,&rdquo; for
&ldquo;That Edward once lay under me,&rdquo; they read
&ldquo;That Englishman lay under me.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, if a
false story, was an example of an art more delicate than Scott
elsewhere exhibits.</p>
<p>One does not know what Professor Child would have said to my
arguments.&nbsp; He never gave a criticism in detail of the
ballad and of the circumstances in which Scott acquired it.&nbsp;
A man most reasonable, most open to conviction, he would, I
think, have confessed his perplexity.</p>
<p>Scott did not interpolate a single stanza, even where, as Hogg
wrote, he suspected a lacuna in the text.&nbsp; He neither cut
out nor improved the cryingly modern stanzas.&nbsp; He kept them,
as he kept several stanzas in <i>Tamlane</i>, which, so he told
Laidlaw, were obviously recent, but were in a copy which he
procured through Lady Dalkeith. <a name="citation51a"></a><a
href="#footnote51a" class="citation">[51a]</a></p>
<p>By neither adding to nor subtracting from his MS. copy of
<i>Auld Maitland</i>, Scott proved, I think, his respect for a
poem which, in its primal form, he believed to be very
ancient.&nbsp; We know, at all events, that ballads on the
Maitland heroes were current about 1580.&nbsp; So, late in the
sixteenth century, were the ballads quoted by Hume of Godscroft,
on the murder of the Knight of Liddesdale (1354), the murder of
the young Earl of Douglas in Edinburgh Castle (1440), and the
battle of Otterburn.&nbsp; Of these three, only <i>Otterburne</i>
was recovered by Herd, published in 1776.&nbsp; The other two are
lost; and there is no <i>prima facie</i> reason why a Maitland
ballad, of the sort current in 1580, should not, in favourable
circumstances, have survived till 1802.</p>
<p>As regards the Shepherd&rsquo;s ideas of honesty in
ballad-collecting at this early period, I have quoted his letter
to Laidlaw of 20th July 1802.</p>
<p>Again, in the case of his text from recitation of the
<i>Ballad of Otterburne</i> (published by Scott in <i>The
Minstrelsy</i> of 1806), he gave the Sheriff a full account of
his mode of handling his materials, and Scott could get more
minute details by questioning him.</p>
<p>To this text of <i>Otterburne</i>, freely attacked by Colonel
Elliot, in apparent ignorance, as before, of the published facts
of the case, and of the manuscript, we next turn our
attention.&nbsp; In the meantime, Scott no more conspired to
forge <i>Auld Maitland</i> than he conspired to forge the
Pentateuch.&nbsp; That Hogg did not forge <i>Auld Maitland</i> I
think I have made as nearly certain as anything in this region
can be.&nbsp; I think that the results are a lesson to professors
of the Higher Criticism of Homer.</p>
<h2><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>THE
BALLAD OF OTTERBURNE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Scott&rsquo;s</span> version of the
<i>Ballad of Otterburne</i>, as given first in <i>The
Minstrelsy</i> of 1806, comes under Colonel Elliot&rsquo;s most
severe censure.&nbsp; He concludes in favour of &ldquo;the view
that it consists partly of stanzas from Percy&rsquo;s
<i>Reliques</i>, which have undergone emendations calculated to
disguise the source from which they came, partly of stanzas of
modern fabrication, and partly of a very few stanzas and lines
from Herd&rsquo;s version&rdquo; (1776). <a
name="citation53a"></a><a href="#footnote53a"
class="citation">[53a]</a></p>
<p>As a matter of fact we know, though Colonel Elliot does not,
the whole process of construction of the <i>Otterburne</i> in
<i>The Minstrelsy</i> of 1806.&nbsp; Professor Child published
all the texts with a letter. <a name="citation53b"></a><a
href="#footnote53b" class="citation">[53b]</a>&nbsp; It is a pity
that Colonel Elliot overlooks facts in favour of
conjecture.&nbsp; Concerning historical facts he is not more
thorough in research.&nbsp; The story, in Percy&rsquo;s
<i>Reliques</i>, of the slaying of Douglas by Percy, &ldquo;is,
so far as I know, supported neither by history nor by
tradition.&rdquo; <a name="citation53c"></a><a
href="#footnote53c" class="citation">[53c]</a>&nbsp; If
unfamiliar with the English chroniclers (in Latin) of the end of
the fourteenth century, Colonel Elliot could find them cited by
Professor Child.&nbsp; Knyghton, Walsingham, and the continuator
of Higden (Malverne), all assert that Percy killed Douglas with
his own hand. <a name="citation54a"></a><a href="#footnote54a"
class="citation">[54a]</a>&nbsp; The English ballad of
<i>Otterburne</i> (in MS. of about 1550) gives this version of
Douglas&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; It is erroneous.&nbsp; Froissart, a
contemporary, had accounts of the battle from combatants, both
English and Scottish.&nbsp; Douglas, fighting in the front of the
van, on a moonlight night, was slain by three lance-wounds
received in the mellay.&nbsp; The English knew not whom they had
slain.</p>
<p>The interesting point is that, while the Scottish ballads give
either the English version of Percy&rsquo;s death (in
<i>Minstrelsy</i>, 1806) or another account mentioned by Hume of
Godscroft (<i>circ.</i> 1610), that he was slain by one of his
own men, the Scottish versions are <i>all</i> deeply affected in
an important point by Froissart&rsquo;s contemporary narrative,
which has not affected the English versions. <a
name="citation54b"></a><a href="#footnote54b"
class="citation">[54b]</a>&nbsp; The point is that the death of
Douglas was by his order concealed from both parties.</p>
<p>When both the English version in Percy&rsquo;s <i>Reliques</i>
(from a MS. of about 1550), and Scott&rsquo;s version of 1806,
mention a &ldquo;challenge to battle&rdquo; between Percy and
Douglas, Colonel Elliot calls this incident &ldquo;probably
purely fanciful and imaginary,&rdquo; and suspects Scott&rsquo;s
version of being made up and altered from the English text.&nbsp;
But the challenge which resulted in the battle of Otterburn is
not fanciful and imaginary!</p>
<p>It is mentioned by Froissart.&nbsp; Douglas, he says, took
Percy&rsquo;s pennon in an encounter under Newcastle.&nbsp; Percy
vowed that Douglas would never carry the pennon out of
Northumberland; Douglas challenged him to come and take it from
his tent door that night; but Percy was constrained not to accept
the challenge.&nbsp; The Scots then marched homewards, but
Douglas insisted on besieging Otterburn Castle; here he passed
some days on purpose to give Percy a chance of a fight;
Percy&rsquo;s force surprised the Scots; they were warned, as in
the ballads, suddenly, by a man who galloped up; the fight began;
and so on.</p>
<p>Now Herd&rsquo;s version says nothing of Douglas at Newcastle;
the whole scene is at Otterburn.&nbsp; On the other hand, Charles
Kirkpatrick Sharpe&rsquo;s MS. text <i>did</i> bring Douglas to
Newcastle.&nbsp; Of this Colonel Elliot says nothing.&nbsp; The
English version says <i>nothing of Percy&rsquo;s loss of his
pennon to Douglas</i> (nor does Sharpe&rsquo;s), and gives the
challenge and tryst.&nbsp; Scott&rsquo;s version says nothing of
Percy&rsquo;s pennon, but Douglas takes Percy&rsquo;s
<i>sword</i> and vows to carry it home.&nbsp; Percy&rsquo;s
challenge, in the English version, is accompanied by a gross
absurdity.&nbsp; He bids Douglas wait at Otterburn, where,
<i>pour tout potage</i> to an army absurdly stated at 40,000 men,
Percy suggests venison and pheasants!&nbsp; In the Scottish
version Percy offers tryst at Otterburn.&nbsp; Douglas answers
that, though Otterburn has no supplies&mdash;nothing but deer and
wild birds&mdash;he will there tarry for Percy.&nbsp; This is
chivalrous, and, in Scott&rsquo;s version, Douglas understands
war.&nbsp; In the English version Percy does not.&nbsp; (To these
facts I return, giving more details.)&nbsp; Colonel Elliot
supposes some one (Scott, I daresay) to have taken
Percy&rsquo;s,&mdash;the English version,&mdash;altered it to
taste, concealed the alterations, as in this part of the
challenge, by inverting the speeches and writing new stanzas of
the fight at Otterburn, used a very little of Herd (which is
true), and inserted modern stanzas.</p>
<p>Now, first, as regards pilfering from the English version,
that version, and Herd&rsquo;s undisputed version, have
undeniably a common source.&nbsp; Neither, as it stands, is
&ldquo;original&rdquo;; of an <i>original</i> contemporary
Otterburn ballad we have no trace.&nbsp; By 1550, when such
ballads were certainly current both in England and Scotland, they
were late, confused by tradition, and, of what we possess, say
Herd&rsquo;s, and the English MS. of 1550, all were
interblended.</p>
<p>The Scots ballad version, known to Hume of Godscroft (1610),
may have been taken from the English, and altered, as Child
thought, or the English, as Motherwell maintained, may have been
borrowed from the Scots, and altered.&nbsp; One or the other
process undeniably occurred; the second poet, who made the
changes, introduced the events most favourable to his country,
and left out the less favourable.&nbsp; By Scott&rsquo;s time, or
Herd&rsquo;s, the versions were much degraded through decay of
memory, bad penny broadsides (lost), and uneducated
reciters.&nbsp; Herd&rsquo;s version has forgotten the historic
affair of the capture of Percy&rsquo;s pennon (and of the whole
movement on Newcastle, preserved in Sharpe&rsquo;s and
Scott&rsquo;s); Scott&rsquo;s remembers the encounter at
Newcastle, forgets the pennon, and substitutes the capture by
Douglas of Percy&rsquo;s sword.&nbsp; The Englishman deliberately
omits the capture of the pennon.&nbsp; The Scots version (here
altered by Sir Walter) makes Percy wound Douglas at
Otterburn&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Till backward he did flee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now Colonel Elliot has no right, I conceive, to argue that
this Scots version, with the Newcastle incident, the captured
sword, the challenge, the &ldquo;backward flight&rdquo; of
Douglas, were introduced by a modern (Scott?) who was
deliberately &ldquo;faking&rdquo; the English version.&nbsp;
There is no reason why tradition should <i>not</i> have retained
historical incidents in the Scottish form; it is a mere
assumption that a modern borrowed and travestied these incidents
from Percy&rsquo;s <i>Reliques</i>.&nbsp; We possess Hogg&rsquo;s
<i>unedited</i> original of Scott&rsquo;s version of 1806 (an
original MS. never hinted at by Colonel Elliot), and it retains
clear traces of being contaminated with a version of <i>The
Huntiss of Chevet</i>, popular in 1459, as we read in <i>The
Complaynte of Scotland</i> of that date.&nbsp; There is also an
old English version of <i>The Hunting of the Cheviot</i> (1550 or
later, Bodleian Library).&nbsp; The <i>unedited</i> text of
Scott&rsquo;s <i>Otterburne</i> then contained traces of <i>The
Huntiss of Chevet</i>; the two were mixed in popular
memory.&nbsp; In short, Scott&rsquo;s text, manipulated slightly
by him in a way which I shall describe, was <i>a thing surviving
in popular memory</i>: how confusedly will be explained.</p>
<p>The differences between the English version of 1550 and the
Scots (collected for Scott by Hogg), are of old standing.&nbsp; I
am not sure that there was not, before 1550, a Scottish ballad,
which the English ballad-monger of that date annexed and
altered.&nbsp; The English version of 1550 is not
&ldquo;popular&rdquo;; it is the work of a humble literary
man.</p>
<p>The English is a very long ballad, in seventy quatrains; it
greatly exaggerates the number of the Scots engaged (40,000), and
it is the work of a professional author who uses the stereotyped
prosaic stopgaps of the cheap hack&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I tell you withouten dread,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is his favourite phrase, and he cites historical
authority&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The cronykle wyll not layne (lie).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scottish ballads do not appeal to chroniclers!&nbsp; A
patriotic and imbecile effort is made by the Englishman to
represent Percy as captured, indeed, but released without
ransom&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>There was then a Scottysh prisoner tayne,<br />
Sir Hew Mongomery was his name;<br />
For sooth as I yow saye,<br />
He borrowed the Persey home agayne.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is obscure, and in any case false.&nbsp; Percy <i>was</i>
taken, and towards his ransom Richard II. paid &pound;3000. <a
name="citation59a"></a><a href="#footnote59a"
class="citation">[59a]</a></p>
<p>It may be well to quote the openings of each ballad, English
and Scots.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">ENGLISH (1550)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Manifestly these copies, so far, are not independent.&nbsp;
But now Herd&rsquo;s copy begins to vary much from the
English.</p>
<p>In both ballads a boy or &ldquo;berne&rdquo; speaks up.&nbsp;
In the English he recommends to the Scots an attack on Newcastle;
in the Scots he announces the approach of an English host.&nbsp;
Douglas promises to reward the boy if his tale be true, to hang
him if it be false.&nbsp; <i>The scene is Otterburn</i>.&nbsp;
The boy stabs Douglas, in a stanza which is a common ballad
formula of frequent occurrence&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The boy&rsquo;s taen out his little pen knife,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That hanget low down by his gare,<br />
And he gaed Earl Douglas a deadly wound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Alack! a deep wound and a sare.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Douglas then says to Sir Hugh Montgomery&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take <i>thou</i> the vanguard of
the three,<br />
And bury me at yon bracken bush,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That stands upon yon lilly lea.&nbsp; (Herd,
4&ndash;8.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hume of Godscroft (about 1610), author of the <i>History of
the Douglases</i>, was fond of quoting ballads.&nbsp; He gives a
form of the first verse in <i>Otterburn</i> which is common to
Herd and the English copy.&nbsp; He says that, according to some,
Douglas was treacherously slain by one of his own men whom he had
offended.&nbsp; &ldquo;But this narration is not so
probable,&rdquo; and the fact is fairly meaningless in
Herd&rsquo;s fragment (the boy has no motive for stabbing
Douglas, for if his report is true, he will be rewarded).&nbsp;
The deed is probably based on the tradition which Godscroft
thought &ldquo;less probable,&rdquo;&mdash;the treacherous murder
of the Earl.</p>
<p>In the English ballad, Douglas marches on Newcastle, where
Percy, without fighting, makes a tryst to meet and combat him at
Otterburn, on his way home from Newcastle to Scotland.&nbsp;
Thither Douglas goes, and is warned by a Scottish knight of
Percy&rsquo;s approach: as in Herd, he is sceptical, but is
convinced by facts.&nbsp; (This warning of Douglas by a scout who
gallops up is narrated by Froissart, from witnesses engaged in
the battle.)&nbsp; After various incidents, Percy and Douglas
encounter each other, and Douglas is slain.&nbsp; After a
desperate fight, Sir Hugh Montgomery, a prisoner of the
English,</p>
<blockquote><p>Borrowed the Percy home again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is absurd.&nbsp; The Scots fought on, took Percy, and won
the day.&nbsp; Walsingham, the contemporary English chronicler
(in Latin), says that Percy slew Douglas, so do Knyghton and the
continuator of Higden.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we observe that the English ballad says nothing of
Douglas&rsquo;s chivalrous fortitude, and soldier-like desire to
have his death concealed.&nbsp; Here every Scottish version
follows Froissart.&nbsp; In Herd&rsquo;s fragment, Montgomery now
attacks Percy, and bids him &ldquo;yield thee to yon bracken
bush,&rdquo; where the dead Douglas&rsquo;s body lies
concealed.&nbsp; Percy does yield&mdash;to Sir Hugh
Montgomery.&nbsp; The fragment has but fourteen stanzas.</p>
<p>In 1802, Scott, correcting by another MS., published
Herd&rsquo;s copy.&nbsp; In 1806 he gave another version, for
&ldquo;fortunately two copies have since been obtained from the
recitation of old persons residing at the head of Ettrick
Forest.&rdquo; <a name="citation62a"></a><a href="#footnote62a"
class="citation">[62a]</a></p>
<p>Colonel Elliot devotes a long digression to the trivial value
of recitations, so styled, <a name="citation62b"></a><a
href="#footnote62b" class="citation">[62b]</a> and gives his
suggestions about the copy being made up from the
<i>Reliques</i>.&nbsp; When Scott&rsquo;s copy of 1806 agrees
with the English version, Colonel Elliot surmises that a modern
person, familiar with the English, has written the coincident
verses in <i>with differences</i>.&nbsp; Percy and Douglas, for
example, change speeches, each saying what, in the English, the
other said in substance, not in the actual words.&nbsp; When
Scott&rsquo;s version touches on an incident known in history,
but not given in the English version, the encounter between
Douglas and Percy at Newcastle (Scott, vii., viii.), Colonel
Elliot suspects the interpolator (and well he may, for the verses
are mawkish and modern, not earlier than the eighteenth century
imitations or <i>remaniements</i> which occur in many ballads
traditional in essence).</p>
<p>So Colonel Elliot says, &ldquo;We are not told, either in
<i>The Minstrelsy</i> or in any of Scott&rsquo;s works or
writings, who the reciters were, and who the transcribers
were.&rdquo; <a name="citation63a"></a><a href="#footnote63a"
class="citation">[63a]</a>&nbsp; We very seldom are told by Scott
who the reciters were and who the transcribers, but our
critic&rsquo;s information is here mournfully limited&mdash;by
his own lack of study.&nbsp; Colonel Elliot goes on to criticise
a very curious feature in Scott&rsquo;s version of 1806, and
finds certain lines &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; but &ldquo;without a
note of antiquity,&rdquo; that he can detect, while the sentiment
&ldquo;is hardly of the kind met with in old ballads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To understand the position we must remember that, <i>in the
English</i>, Percy and Douglas fight each other thus
(1.)&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Percy and the Douglas met,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That either of other was fain,<br />
They swapped together while that they sweat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With swords of fine Collayne.&nbsp; (Cologne
steel.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Douglas bids Percy yield, but Percy slays Douglas (as in
Walsingham&rsquo;s and other contemporary chronicles, stanzas
li.&ndash;lvi.).&nbsp; The Scottish losses are then enumerated
(only eighteen Scots were left alive!), and stanza lix.
runs&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>This fray began at Otterburn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Between the night and the day.<br />
There the Douglas lost his life,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Percy was led away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Herd ends&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>This deed was done at Otterburn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; About the breaking of the day,<br />
Earl Douglas was buried at the bracken bush,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Percy led captive away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Manifestly, either the maker of Herd&rsquo;s version knew the
English, and altered at pleasure, or the Englishman knew a Scots
version, and altered at pleasure.&nbsp; The perversion is of
ancient standing, undeniably.&nbsp; But when Scott&rsquo;s
original text exhibits the same phenomena of perversion, in a
part of the ballad missing in Herd&rsquo;s brief lay, Colonel
Elliot supposes that <i>now</i> the exchanges are by a modern
ballad-forger, shall we say Sir Walter?&nbsp; By Sir Walter they
certainly are <i>not</i>!&nbsp; One tiny hint of Scots
originality is dubious.&nbsp; In the English, and in all Scots
versions, men &ldquo;win their hay&rdquo; at Lammastide.&nbsp; In
Scotland the hay harvest is often much later.&nbsp; But if the
English ballad be <i>Northumbrian</i>, little can be made out of
that proof of Scottish origin.&nbsp; If the English version be a
southern version (for the minstrel is a professional), then
Lammastide for hay-making is borrowed from the Scots.</p>
<p>The Scots version (Herd&rsquo;s) insists on Douglas&rsquo;s
burial &ldquo;by the bracken bush,&rdquo; to which Montgomery
bids Percy surrender.&nbsp; This is obviously done to hide his
body and keep his death secret from both parties, <i>as in
Froissart he bids his friends do</i>.&nbsp; The verse of the
English (l.) on the fight between Douglas and Percy, is borrowed
by, or is borrowed from, the Scottish stanza (ix.) in Herd, where
Sir Hugh Montgomery fights Percy.</p>
<blockquote><p>Then Percy and Montgomery met,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And weel a wot they warna fain;<br />
They swaped swords, and they twa swat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And ay the blood ran down between.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Persses and the Mongomry met,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as quoted, is already familiar in <i>The Complaynte of
Scotland</i> (about 1549), and this line is not in the English
ballad.&nbsp; So far it seems as if the English balladist
borrowed the scene from a Scots version, and perverted it into a
description of a fight, between Percy, who wins, and
Douglas&mdash;in place of the Scots version, the victory over
Percy of Sir Hugh Montgomery.</p>
<p>This transference of incidents in the English and Scottish
ballads is a phenomenon which we are to meet again in the ballad
of <i>Jamie Telfer of the Fair Dodhead</i>.&nbsp; One
&ldquo;maker&rdquo; or the other has, in old times, pirated and
perverted the ballad of another &ldquo;maker.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>SCOTT&rsquo;S TRADITIONAL COPY AND HOW HE EDITED IT</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> early as December
1802&ndash;January 1803, Scott was &ldquo;so anxious to have a
complete Scottish <i>Otterburn</i> that I will omit the ballad
entirely in the first volume (of 1803), hoping to recover it in
time for insertion in the third.&rdquo; <a
name="citation67a"></a><a href="#footnote67a"
class="citation">[67a]</a></p>
<p>The letter is undated, but is determined by Scott&rsquo;s
expressed interest &ldquo;about the Tushielaw lines, which, from
what you mention, must be worth recovering.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a
letter (Abbotsford MSS.) from Hogg to Scott (marked in copy,
&ldquo;January 7, 1803&rdquo;) Hogg encloses &ldquo;the Tushielaw
lines,&rdquo; which were popular in Ettrick, but were verses of
the eighteenth century.&nbsp; They were orally repeated, but
literary in origin.</p>
<p>Scott, who wanted &ldquo;a complete Scottish Otterburn&rdquo;
in winter 1802, did not sit down and make one.&nbsp; He waited
till he got a text from Hogg, in 1805, and published an edited
version in 1806.</p>
<p><i>Scott&rsquo;s published</i> stanza i. is Herd&rsquo;s
stanza i., with slight verbal changes taken from the Hogg MS.
text of 1805. (?)&nbsp; Hogg&rsquo;s MS. and Scott, in stanza
ii., give Herd&rsquo;s lines on the Lindsays and Gordons, adding
the Grahams, and, in place of Herd&rsquo;s</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of
Fife,<br />
And Sir Hugh Montgomery upon a grey,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>they end thus&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>But the Jardines wald not wi&rsquo; him ride,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they rue it to this day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is from Hogg&rsquo;s copy; it is a natural Border
variant.&nbsp; No Earl of Fife is named, but a reproach to a
Border clan is conveyed.</p>
<p>For Herd&rsquo;s iii. (they take Northumberland, and burn
&ldquo;the North shire,&rdquo; and the Otter dale), Hogg&rsquo;s
reciters gave&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>And he has burned the dales o&rsquo; Tyne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And part o&rsquo; <i>Almonshire</i>,<br />
And three good towers in Roxburgh fells,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He left them all on fire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hogg, in his letter accompanying his copy, says that
&ldquo;Almonshire&rdquo; may stand for the
&ldquo;Bamborowshire&rdquo; of the English vi., but that he
leaves in &ldquo;Almonshire,&rdquo; as both reciters insist on
it.&nbsp; Scott printed &ldquo;Bambroughshire,&rdquo; as in the
English version (vi.).</p>
<p>Now here is proof that Hogg had a copy, from reciters&mdash;a
copy which he could not understand.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Almonshire&rdquo; is &ldquo;Alneshire,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Alnwickshire,&rdquo; where is the Percy&rsquo;s Alnwick
Castle.&nbsp; In Froissart the Scots burn and waste the region of
Alneshire, all round Alnwick, but the Earl of Northumberland
holds out in the castle, unattacked, and sends his sons, Henry
and Ralph Percy, to Newcastle to gather forces, and take the
retreating Scots between two fires, Newcastle and Alnwick.&nbsp;
But the Scots were not such poor strategists as to return by the
way they had come.&nbsp; In a skirmish or joust at Newcastle,
says Froissart, Douglas captured Percy&rsquo;s lance and pennon,
with his blazon of arms, and vowed that he would set it up over
his castle of Dalkeith.&nbsp; Percy replied that he would never
carry it out of England.&nbsp; To give Percy a chivalrous chance
of recovering his pennon and making good his word, Douglas
insists on waiting at Otterburn to besiege the castle there; and
he is taken by surprise (as in the ballads) when a mounted man
brings news of Percy&rsquo;s approach.&nbsp; No tryst is made by
Percy and Douglas <i>at Otterburn</i> in Froissart; Douglas
merely tarried there by the courtesy of Scotland.</p>
<p>In Hogg&rsquo;s version we have a reason why Douglas should
tarry at Otterburn; in the English ballad we have none very
definite.&nbsp; No captured pennon of Percy&rsquo;s is mentioned,
no encounter of the heroes &ldquo;at the barriers&rdquo; of
Newcastle.&nbsp; Percy, from the castle wall, merely threatens
Douglas vaguely; Douglas says, &ldquo;Where will you meet
me?&rdquo; and Percy appoints Otterburn as we said.&nbsp; He
makes the absurd remark that, by way of supplies (for 40,000
men), Douglas will find abundance of pheasants and red deer. <a
name="citation69a"></a><a href="#footnote69a"
class="citation">[69a]</a></p>
<p>We see that the English balladist is an unwarlike literary
hack.&nbsp; The author of the Ettrick version knew better the
nature of war, as we shall see, and his Douglas objects to
Otterburn as a place destitute of supplies; nothing is there but
wild beasts and birds.&nbsp; If the original poem is the sensible
poem, the Scott version is the original which the English hath
perverted.</p>
<p>In Hogg, Douglas jousts with Percy at Newcastle, and gives him
a fall.&nbsp; Then come two verses (viii.&ndash;ix.).&nbsp; The
second is especially modern and mawkish&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>But O how pale his lady look&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Frae off the castle wa&rsquo;,<br />
When down before the Scottish spear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She saw brave Percy fa&rsquo;!<br />
How pale and wan his lady look&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Frae off the castle hieght,<br />
When she beheld her Percy yield<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To doughty Douglas&rsquo; might.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Colonel Elliot asks, &ldquo;Can any one believe that these
stanzas are really ancient and have come down orally through many
generations?&rdquo; <a name="citation70a"></a><a
href="#footnote70a" class="citation">[70a]</a></p>
<p>Certainly not!&nbsp; But Colonel Elliot does not allow for the
fact, insisted on by Professor Child, that traditional ballads,
from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, were often
printed on broad-sheets as edited by the cheapest
broadside-vendors&rsquo; hacks; that the hacks interpolated and
messed their originals; and that, after the broadside was worn
out, lost, or burned, oral memory kept it alive in
tradition.&nbsp; For examples of this process we have only to
look at <i>William&rsquo;s Ghost</i> in Herd&rsquo;s copy of
1776.&nbsp; This is a traditional ballad; it is included in
Scott&rsquo;s <i>Clerk Saunders</i>, but, as Hogg told him, is a
quite distinct song.&nbsp; In Herd&rsquo;s copy it ends
thus&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh, stay, my only true love,
stay,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The constant Marg&rsquo;ret cry&rsquo;d;<br />
Wan grew her cheeks, she closed her eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stretched her soft limbs, and dy&rsquo;d.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let <i>this</i> get into tradition, and be taken down from
recitation, and the ballad will be denounced as modern.&nbsp; But
it is essentially ancient.</p>
<p>These two modern stanzas, in Hogg&rsquo;s copy, are rather too
bad for Hogg&rsquo;s making; and I do not know whether they are
his (he practically says they are not, we shall see), or whether
they are remembered by reciters from a stall-copy of the period
of Lady Wardlaw&rsquo;s <i>Hardyknute</i>.</p>
<p>After that, Hogg&rsquo;s copy becomes more natural.&nbsp;
Douglas says to the discomfited Percy (x.)&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Had we twa been upon the green,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And never an eye to see,<br />
I should hae had ye flesh and fell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But your sword shall gae wi&rsquo; me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That rings true!&nbsp; Moreover, had either Hogg or Scott
tampered here (Scott excised), either would have made Douglas
carry off&mdash;not Percy&rsquo;s <i>sword</i>, but the historic
captured <i>pennon</i> of Percy.&nbsp; Scott really could not
have resisted the temptation had he been interpolating
<i>&agrave; son d&eacute;vis</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>But your <i>pennon</i> shall gae wi&rsquo; me!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was easy to write in that!</p>
<p>Percy had challenged Douglas thus&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>But gae ye up to Otterburn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And there wait days three (xi.),</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as in the English (xiii.).&nbsp; In the English, Percy, we
saw, promises game enough there; in Hogg, Douglas demurs (xii.,
xiii., xiv.).&nbsp; There are no supplies at Otterburn, he
says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feed my men and me.</p>
<p>The deer rins wild frae dale to dale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The birds fly wild frae tree to tree,<br />
And there is neither bread nor kale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To fend my men and me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These seem to me sound true ballad lines, like&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>My hounds may a&rsquo; rin masterless<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My hawks may fly frae tree to tree,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in Child&rsquo;s variant of <i>Young Beichan</i>.&nbsp; The
speakers, we see, are &ldquo;inverted.&rdquo;&nbsp; Percy, in the
English, promises Douglas&rsquo;s men pheasants&mdash;absurd
provision for the army of 40,000 men of the English ballad.&nbsp;
In the Ettrick text Douglas says that there are no supplies,
merely <i>fer&aelig; natur&aelig;</i>, but he will wait at
Otterburn to give Percy his chance.</p>
<p>Colonel Elliot takes the inversion of parts as a proof of
modern pilfering and deliberate change to hide the theft; at
least he mentions them, and the &ldquo;prettier verses,&rdquo;
with a note of exclamation (!). <a name="citation73a"></a><a
href="#footnote73a" class="citation">[73a]</a>&nbsp; But there
are, we repeat, similar inversions in the English and in
Herd&rsquo;s old copy, and nobody says that Scott or Hogg or any
modern faker made the inversions in Herd&rsquo;s text.&nbsp; The
differences and inversions in the English and in Herd are very
ancient; by 1550 &ldquo;the Percy and the Montgomery met,&rdquo;
in the line quoted in <i>The Complaynte of Scotland</i>.&nbsp; At
about the same period (1550) it was the Percy and the Douglas who
met, in the English version.&nbsp; Manifestly there pre-existed,
by 1550, an old ballad, which either a Scot then perverted from
the English text, or an Englishman from the Scots.&nbsp; Thus the
inversions in the Ettrick and English version need not be due
(they are not due) to a <i>modern</i> &ldquo;faker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Hogg MS. (xxiii.), Percy wounds Douglas &ldquo;till
backwards he did flee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hogg was too good a Scot to
interpolate the flight of Douglas; and Scott was so good a Scot
that&mdash;what do you suppose he did?&mdash;he excised
&ldquo;till backwards he did flee&rdquo; from Hogg&rsquo;s text,
and inserted &ldquo;that he fell to the ground&rdquo; <i>from the
English text</i>!</p>
<p>In the Hogg MS. (xviii., xix.), in Scott xvii., xviii.,
Douglas, at Otterburn, is roused from sleep by his page with news
of Percy&rsquo;s approach.&nbsp; Douglas says that the page lies
(compare Herd, where Douglas doubts the page)&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>For Percy hadna&rsquo; men yestreen<br />
To dight my men and me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is nothing in this to surprise any one who knows the
innumerable variants in traditional ballads.&nbsp; But now comes
in a very curious variation (Hogg MS. xx., Scott, xix.).&nbsp;
Douglas says (Hogg MS. xx.)&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>But I have seen a dreary dream<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the Isle o&rsquo; Skye,<br />
I saw a dead man won the fight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think that man was I.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is something not in Herd, and as remote from the manner
of the English poet, with his</p>
<blockquote><p>The Chronicle will not lie,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as Heine is remote from, say,&mdash;Milman.&nbsp; The verse is
magical, it has haunted my memory since I was ten years
old.&nbsp; Godscroft, who does not approve of the story of
Douglas&rsquo;s murder by one of his men, writes that the dying
leader said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First do yee keep my death both from our own folke and
from the enemy&rdquo; (Froissart, &ldquo;Let neither friend nor
foe know of my estate&rdquo;); &ldquo;then that ye suffer not my
standard to be lost or cast downe&rdquo; (Froissart, &ldquo;Up
with my standard and call <i>Douglas</i>!&rdquo;;) &ldquo;and
last, that ye avenge my death&rdquo; (also in Froissart).&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bury me at Melrose Abbey with my father.&nbsp; If I could
hope for these things I should die with the greater contentment;
for long since I <i>heard a prophesie that a dead man should
winne a field</i>, <i>and I hope in God it shall be I</i>.&rdquo;
<a name="citation75a"></a><a href="#footnote75a"
class="citation">[75a]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>I saw a dead man won the fight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think that man was I!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Godscroft, up to the mention of Melrose and the prophecy, took
his tale direct from Froissart, or, if he took it from George
Buchanan&rsquo;s Latin History, Buchanan&rsquo;s source was
Froissart, but Froissart&rsquo;s was evidence from Scots who were
in the battle.</p>
<p>But who changed the prophecy to a dream of Douglas, and who
versified Godscroft&rsquo;s &ldquo;a dead man shall winne a
field, and I hope in God it shall be I&rdquo;?&nbsp; Did
Godscroft take that from the ballad current in his time and
quoted by him?&nbsp; Or did a <i>remanieur</i> of Godscroft turn
<i>his</i> words into</p>
<blockquote><p>I saw a dead man win the fight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think that man was I?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scott did not make these two noble lines out of Godscroft, he
found them in Hogg&rsquo;s copy from recitation, only altering
&ldquo;I saw&rdquo; into &ldquo;I dreamed,&rdquo; and the
ungrammatic &ldquo;won&rdquo; into &ldquo;win&rdquo;; and
&ldquo;<i>the</i> fight&rdquo; into &ldquo;<i>a</i>
fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole dream stanza occurs in a part of the ballad where
Hogg confesses to no alteration or interpolation, and I doubt if
the Shepherd of Ettrick had read a rare old book like
Godscroft.&nbsp; If he had not, this stanza is purely
traditional; if he had, he showed great genius in his use of
Godscroft.</p>
<p>In Hogg&rsquo;s Ettrick copy, Douglas, after telling his
dream, rushes into battle, is wounded by Percy, and
&ldquo;backward flees.&rdquo;&nbsp; Scott (xx.), following a
historical version (Wyntoun&rsquo;s <i>Cronykil</i>), makes</p>
<blockquote><p>Douglas forget the helmit good<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That should have kept his brain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being wounded, in Hogg&rsquo;s version, and &ldquo;backward
fleeing,&rdquo; Douglas sends his page to bring Montgomery
(Hogg), and from stanza xxiv. to xxxiv., in Hogg, all is made up
by himself, he says,&mdash;from facts given &ldquo;in plain
prose&rdquo; by his reciters, with here and there a line or two
given in verse.&nbsp; Scott omitted some verses here, amended
others slightly, by help of Herd&rsquo;s version, <i>left out a
broken last stanza</i> (xl.) and put in Herd&rsquo;s concluding
lines (stanza lxviii. in the English text).</p>
<blockquote><p>This deed was done at the Otterburn. (Herd.)</p>
<p>The fraye began at Otterburn. (English.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now what was the broken Ettrick stanza that Scott omitted in
his published <i>Otterburne</i> (1806)?&nbsp; It referred to Sir
Hugh Montgomery, who, in Herd, captured Percy after a fight; in
the English version is a prisoner apparently exchanged for
Percy.&nbsp; In the Ettrick MS. the omitted verse is</p>
<blockquote><p>He left not an Englishman on the field<br />
. . .<br />
That he hadna either killed or taen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere his heart&rsquo;s blood was cauld.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scott ended with Herd&rsquo;s last stanza; in the English
version the last but two.</p>
<p>Now the death, at Otterburn, of Sir Hugh, is recorded in an
English ballad styled <i>The Hunting of the Cheviot</i>.&nbsp; By
1540&ndash;50 it was among the popular songs north of
Tweed.&nbsp; <i>The Complaynte of Scotland</i> (1549) mentions
among &ldquo;The Songis of Natural Music of the Antiquitie&rdquo;
(<i>volkslieder</i>), <i>The Hunttis of Chevet</i>.&nbsp; Our
copy of the English version is in the Bodleian (MS. Ashmole,
48).&nbsp; It ends: &ldquo;Expliceth, quod Rychard Sheale,&rdquo;
a minstrel who recited ballads and tales at Tamworth
(<i>circ.</i> 1559).&nbsp; The text was part of his
stock-in-trade.</p>
<p>The Cheviot ballad, in a Scots form popular in 1549, is later
in many ways than the English <i>Battle of Otterburne</i>.&nbsp;
It begins with a brag of Percy, a vow that, despite Douglas, he
will hunt in the Cheviot hills.&nbsp; While Percy is hunting with
a strong force, Douglas arrives with another.&nbsp; Douglas
offers to decide the quarrel by single combat with Percy, who
accepts.&nbsp; Richard Witherington refuses to look on quietly,
and a general engagement ensues.</p>
<blockquote><p>At last the Duglas and the Perse met,<br />
Lyk to Captayns of myght and of mayne,<br />
They swapte together tylle they both swat<br />
With swordes that wear of fyn myllan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are back in stanza I. of the English <i>Otterburne</i>, in
stanza xxxv. (substituting Hugh Montgomery for Douglas) of the
Hogg MS.&nbsp; In <i>The Hunting</i>, Douglas is slain by an
English arrow (xxxvi.&ndash;xxxviii.).</p>
<p>Sir Hugh Montgomery now charges and slays Percy (who, of
course, was merely taken prisoner).&nbsp; An archer of
Northumberland sends an arrow through good Sir Hugh Montgomery
(xliii.&ndash;xlvi.).&nbsp; Stanza lxvi. has</p>
<blockquote><p>At Otterburn begane this spurne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon a Monnynday;<br />
There was the doughte Douglas slean,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Perse never went away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a form of Herd&rsquo;s stanza xiv. of the English
<i>Otterburn</i> (lxviii.), made soon after the battle.&nbsp; We
see that the <i>original</i> ballad has protean variants; in time
all is mixed in tradition.</p>
<p>Now the curious and interesting point is that Hogg, when he
collected the ballad from two reciters, himself noticed that the
<i>Cheviot</i> ballad had merged, in some way, into the
<i>Otterburn</i> ballad, and pointed this out to Scott.&nbsp; I
now publish Hogg&rsquo;s letter to Scott, in which, as usual, he
does not give the year-date: I think it was 1805.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Ettrick House</span>, <i>Sept.</i> 10, [?1805].</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Though I have used
all diligence in my power to recover the old song about which you
seemed anxious, I am afraid it will arrive too late to be of any
use.&nbsp; I cannot at this time have Grame and Bewick; the only
person who hath it being absent at a harvest; and as for the
scraps of Otterburn which you have got, <i>they seem to have been
some confused jumble made by some person who had learned both the
songs you have</i>, <a name="citation79a"></a><a
href="#footnote79a" class="citation">[79a]</a> <i>and in time had
been straitened to make one out of them both</i>.&nbsp; But you
shall have it as I had it, saving that, as usual, I have
sometimes helped the metre without altering one original
word.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hogg here gives his version from recitation as far as stanza
xxiv.</p>
<p>Here Hogg stops and writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The ballad, which I have collected from two
different people, a crazy old man and a woman deranged in her
mind, seems hitherto considerably entire; but now, when it
becomes most interesting, they have both failed me, and I have
been obliged to take much of it in plain prose.&nbsp; However, as
none of them seemed to know anything of the history save what
they had learned from the song, I took it the more kindly.&nbsp;
Any few verses which follow are to me unintelligible.</p>
<p>He told Sir Hugh that he was dying, and ordered him to conceal
his body, and neither let his own men nor Piercy&rsquo;s know;
which he did, and the battle went on headed by Sir Hugh
Montgomery, and at length&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here follow stanzas up to xxxviii.</p>
<p>Hogg then goes on thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Piercy seems to have been fighting devilishly in
the dark.&nbsp; Indeed my narrators added no more, but told me
that Sir Hugh died on the field, but that</p>
<p>He left not an Englishman on the field,<br />
. . .<br />
That he hadna either killed or ta&rsquo;en<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere his heart&rsquo;s blood was cauld.</p>
<p>Almonshire (Stanza iii.) may probably be a corruption of
Bamburghshire, but as both my narrators called it so I thought
proper to preserve it.&nbsp; The towers in Roxburgh fells (Stanza
iii.) may not be so improper as we were thinking, there may have
been some [English] strength on the very borders.&mdash;I remain,
Dear Sir, your most faithful and affectionate servant, <span
class="smcap">James Hogg</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hogg adds a postscript:</p>
<blockquote><p>Not being able to get the letter away to the post,
I have taken the opportunity of again pumping my old
friend&rsquo;s memory, and have recovered some more lines and
half lines of Otterburn, of which I am becoming somewhat
enamoured.&nbsp; These I have been obliged to arrange somewhat
myself, as you will see below, but so mixed are they with
original lines and sentences that I think, if you pleased, they
might pass without any acknowledgment.&nbsp; Sure no man will
like an old song the worse of being somewhat harmonious.&nbsp;
After stanza xxiv. you may read stanzas xxv. to xxxiv.&nbsp; Then
after xxxviii. read xxxix.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we know all that can be known about the copy of the ballad
which, in 1805, Scott received from Hogg.&nbsp; Up to stanza
xxiv. it is as given by the two old reciters.&nbsp; The crazy man
may be the daft man who recited to Hogg Burns&rsquo;s <i>Tam
o&rsquo; Shanter</i>, and inspired him with the ambition to be a
poet.&nbsp; The deranged woman, like mad Madge Wildfire, was rich
in ballad scraps.&nbsp; From stanza xxv. to xxxiv., Hogg
confessedly &ldquo;harmonises&rdquo; what he got in plain prose
intermixed with verse.&nbsp; Stanza xxxix. is apparently
Hogg&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The last broken stanza, as Hogg said, is a
reminiscence of the <i>Hunting of the Cheviot</i>, in a Scots
form, long lost.</p>
<p>Hogg was not a scientific collector: had he been, he would
have taken down &ldquo;the plain prose&rdquo; and the broken
lines and stanzas verbally.&nbsp; But Hogg has done his best.</p>
<p>We have next to ask, How did Scott treat the material thus
placed before him?&nbsp; He dropped five stanzas sent by Hogg,
mainly from the part made up from &ldquo;plain prose&rdquo;; he
placed in a stanza and a line or two from Herd&rsquo;s text; he
remade a stanza and adopted a line from the English of 1550, and
inserted an incident from Wyntoun&rsquo;s <i>Cronykil</i> (about
1430).&nbsp; He did these things in the effort to construct what
Lockhart calls &ldquo;a standard text.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; In stanza i., for Hogg&rsquo;s &ldquo;Douglas
<i>went</i>,&rdquo; Scott put &ldquo;bound him to

<p>25.&nbsp; (<i>H.</i>) Here Hogg has mixed prose and verse, and
does his best.&nbsp; Scott deletes Hogg&rsquo;s 25.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp; (<i>H.</i>) Douglas repeats the story of his
dream.&nbsp; Scott deletes the stanza.</p>
<p>28.&nbsp; In Hogg&rsquo;s second line,</p>
<blockquote><p>Nae mair I&rsquo;ll fighting see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scott gives, from Herd,</p>
<blockquote><p>Take thou the vanguard of the three.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>29.&nbsp; Hogg&rsquo;s verse is</p>
<blockquote><p>But tell na ane of my brave men<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I lie bleeding wan,<br />
But let the name of Douglas still<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be shouted in the van.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is precisely what Douglas does say, in Froissart, but
Scott deletes the stanza.&nbsp; Probably Hogg got the fact from
his reciters, &ldquo;in plain prose,&rdquo; with a phrase or two
in verse.</p>
<p>31.&nbsp; (<i>H.</i>) Line 4.</p>

<p>40.&nbsp; (<i>H.</i>) Hogg&rsquo;s broken stanza on the death
of Montgomery, derived from a lost form of the <i>Huntiss of
Chevets</i>, named in <i>The Complaynte of Scotland</i>.</p>
<p>35.&nbsp; (<i>S.</i>) Scott omits giving the formula common to
the English of 1550 and to Herd.&nbsp; This was the whole of
Scott&rsquo;s editorial alteration.&nbsp; Any one may discover
the facts from Professor Kittredge&rsquo;s useful abbreviation of
Child&rsquo;s collection into a single volume (Nutt.&nbsp;
London, 1905).&nbsp; Colonel Elliot quotes Professor
Kittredge&rsquo;s book three or four times, but in place of
looking at the facts he abounds in the Higher Criticism.&nbsp;
Colonel Elliot says that Scott does not tell us of a single line
having been borrowed from Percy&rsquo;s version. <a
name="citation84b"></a><a href="#footnote84b"
class="citation">[84b]</a>&nbsp; Scott has only &ldquo;a single
line&rdquo; to tell of, the fourth line in his stanza xxii.,
&ldquo;Till he fell to the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the rest, the old English version and Herd&rsquo;s have
many inter-borrowings of stanzas, but we do not know whether a
Scot borrowed from an Englishman, or <i>vice versa</i>.&nbsp;
Thus, in another and longer traditional
version&mdash;Hogg&rsquo;s&mdash;more correspondence must be
expected than in Herd&rsquo;s fourteen stanzas.&nbsp; It is, of
course, open to scepticism to allege that Hogg merely made his
text, invented the two crazy old reciters, and the whole story
about them, and his second &ldquo;pumping of their
memories,&rdquo; invented &ldquo;Almonshire,&rdquo; which he
could not understand, and invented his last broken stanza on the
death of Montgomery, to give the idea that <i>The Huntiss of
Chevets</i> was mingled in the recollections of the reciters with
<i>The Battle of Otterburn</i>.&nbsp; He also gave the sword in
place of the pennon of Percy as the trophy of Douglas, &ldquo;and
the same with intent to deceive,&rdquo; just as he pretended, in
<i>Auld Maitland</i>, not to know what &ldquo;springwalls&rdquo;
were, and wrote &ldquo;springs: wall-stanes.&rdquo;&nbsp; If this
probable theory be correct, then Scott was the dupe of Truthful
James.&nbsp; At all events, though for three years Scott was
moving heaven and earth and Ettrick Forest to find a copy of a
Scottish ballad of Otterburn, he did not sit down and make one,
as, in Colonel Elliot&rsquo;s system, he easily could and
probably would have done.</p>
<p>Before studying his next ill deed, we must repeat that the
Otterburn ballads prove that in early times one nation certainly
pirated a ballad of a rival nation, and very ingeniously altered
it and inverted the parts of the heroes.</p>
<p>We have next to examine a case in a later generation, in which
a maker who was interested in one clan, pirated, perverted, and
introverted the <i>r&ocirc;les</i> of the heroes in a ballad by a
maker interested in another clan.&nbsp; Either an Elliotophile
perverted a ballad by a Scottophile, or a Scottophile perverted a
ballad by an Elliotophile.</p>
<p>This might be done at the time when the ballad was made (say
1620&ndash;60).&nbsp; But Colonel Elliot believes that the
perversion was inflicted on an Elliotophile ballad by a
Scottophile impostor about 1800&ndash;1802.&nbsp; The name of
this desperate and unscrupulous character was Walter Scott,
Sheriff of Ettrick Forest, commonly called Selkirkshire.</p>
<p>In this instance I have no manuscript evidence.&nbsp; The name
of &ldquo;Jamie of the Fair Dodhead,&rdquo; the ballad, appears
in a list of twenty-two ballads in Sir Walter&rsquo;s hand,
written in a commonplace book about 1800&ndash;1801.&nbsp; Eleven
are marked X.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jamie&rdquo; is one of that
eleven.&nbsp; <i>Kinmont Willie</i> is among the eleven not
marked X.&nbsp; We may conjecture that he had obtained the first
eleven, and was hunting for the second eleven,&mdash;some of
which he never got, or never published.</p>
<h2><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>THE
MYSTERY OF THE BALLAD OF JAMIE TELFER</h2>
<h3>I<br />
A RIDING SONG</h3>
<p><i>The Ballad of Jamie Telfer of the Fair Dodhead</i> has many
charms for lovers of the Border.&nbsp; The swift and simple
stanzas carry us through a great tract of country, which remains
not unlike what it was in the days when Scotts, Armstrongs, and
Elliots rode the hills in jack and knapscap, with sword and
lance.&nbsp; The song leads us first, with a foraging party of
English riders, from Bewcastle, an English hold, east of the
Border stream of the Liddel; then through the Armstrong tribe, on
the north bank; then through more Armstrongs north across Tarras
water (&ldquo;Tarras for the good bull trout&rdquo;); then north
up Ewes water, that springs from the feet of the changeless green
hills and the <i>pastorum loca vasta</i>, where now only the
shepherd or the angler wakens the cry of the curlews, but where
then the Armstrongs were in force.&nbsp; We ride on, as it were,
and look down into the dale of the stripling Teviot, <i>electro
clarior</i> (then held by the Scotts); we descend and ford
&ldquo;Borthwick&rsquo;s roaring strand,&rdquo; as Leyden sings,
though the burn is usually a purling brook even where it joins
Teviot, three miles above Hawick.</p>
<p>Next we pass across the green waves of moorlands that rise to
the heights over Ettrick (held by the Scotts), whence the
foragers of the song gallop down to &ldquo;The Fair
Dodhead,&rdquo; now a heap of grass-covered stones, but in their
day a peel tower, occupied, <i>according to the ballad</i>, by
one James Telfer.&nbsp; The English rob the peel tower, they
drive away ten cows, and urge them southwards over Borthwick
water, then across Teviot at Coultart Cleugh (say seven miles
above Hawick), then up the Frostily burn, and so down Ewes water
as before; but the Scottish pursuers meet them before they cross
the Liddel again into English bounds.&nbsp; The English are
defeated, their captain is shot through the head (which in no way
affects his power of making speeches); he is taken, twenty or
thirty of his men are killed or wounded, his own cattle are
seized, and his victim Telfer, returns rejoicing to Dodhead in
distant Ettrick.</p>
<p><i>C&rsquo;est magnifique</i>, <i>mais ce n&rsquo;est pas la
guerre</i>!&nbsp; These events never occurred, as we shall see
later, yet the poet has the old reiving spirit, the full sense of
the fierce manly times, and possesses a traditional knowledge of
the historical personages of the day, and knows the
country,&mdash;more or less.</p>
<p>The poem has raised as many difficulties as Nestor&rsquo;s
long story about raided cattle in the eleventh book of the
<i>Iliad</i>.&nbsp; Historical Greece knew but dimly the places
which were familiar to Nestor, the towns that time had ruined,
the hill where Athene &ldquo;turned the people
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; We, too, have to seek in documents of the end
of the sixteenth century, or in an old map of 1654 (drawn about
1600), to find Dodhead, Catslack, or Catloch, or Catlock hill,
and Preakinhaugh, places essential to our inquiry.</p>
<p>I see the student who has ventured so far into my tract wax
wan!&nbsp; He does not,&mdash;she does not,&mdash;wish to hear
about dusty documents and ancient maps.&nbsp; For him or for her
the ballad is enough, and a very good ballad it is.&nbsp; I would
shake the faith of no man in the accuracy of the ballad tale, if
it were not necessary for me to defend the character of Sir
Walter Scott, which, on occasion of this and other ballads, is
impugned by Colonel the Hon. FitzWilliam Elliot.&nbsp; He
&ldquo;hopes, though he cannot expect,&rdquo; that I will give my
reasons for not sharing his belief that Sir Walter did a certain
thing which I could not easily palliate. <a
name="citation89"></a><a href="#footnote89"
class="citation">[89]</a></p>
<h3>II<br />
THE BALLAD IMPOSSIBLE</h3>
<p>My attempts to relieve Colonel Elliot from his painful
convictions about Sir Walter&rsquo;s unsportsmanlike behaviour
must begin with proof that the ballad, as it stands, cannot
conceivably be other than &ldquo;a pack o&rsquo;
lees.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here Colonel Elliot, to a great extent and on
an essential point, agrees with me.&nbsp; In sketching rapidly
the story of the ballad,&mdash;the raid from England into
Ettrick, the return of the raiders, the pursuit,&mdash;I omitted
the <i>clou</i>, the pivot, the central point of dramatic
interest.&nbsp; It is this: in one version of the
ballad,&mdash;call it A for the present,&mdash;the unfortunate
Telfer runs to ask aid from the laird of Buccleuch, at Branksome
Hall, some three and a half or four miles above Hawick, on the
Teviot.&nbsp; From the Dodhead it was a stiff run of eight miles,
through new-fallen snow.&nbsp; The farmer of Dodhead, in the
centre of the Scott country, naturally went for help to the
nearest of his neighbours, the greatest chief in the
mid-Border.&nbsp; In version A (which I shall call &ldquo;the
Elliot version&rdquo;), &ldquo;auld Buccleuch&rdquo; (who was a
man of about thirty in fact) was deaf to Telfer&rsquo;s
prayer.</p>
<blockquote><p>Gae seek your succour frae Martin Elliot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For succour ye&rsquo;s get nane frae me,<br />
Gae seek your succour where ye paid blackmail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For, man, ye ne&rsquo;er paid money to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is impossibly absurd!&nbsp; As Colonel Elliot writes,
&ldquo;I pointed out in my book&rdquo; (<i>The Trustworthiness of
Border Ballads</i>) &ldquo;that the allegation that Buccleuch had
refused to strike a blow at a party of English raiders, who had
insolently ridden some twenty-five miles into Scottish ground and
into the very middle of his own territory, was too absurd to be
believed . . . &rdquo; <a name="citation91a"></a><a
href="#footnote91a" class="citation">[91a]</a></p>
<p>Certainly; and the story is the more ridiculous as Buccleuch
(who has taken Telfer&rsquo;s protection-money, or
&ldquo;blackmail&rdquo;) pretends to believe that
Telfer&mdash;living in Ettrick, about nine miles from
Selkirk&mdash;pays protection-money to Martin Elliot, residing at
Preakinhaugh, high up the water of Liddel.&nbsp; Martin was too
small a potentate, and far too remote to be chosen as protector
by a man living near the farm of Singlee on Ettrick, and near the
bold Buccleuch.</p>
<p>All this is nonsense.&nbsp; Colonel Elliot sees that, and
suggests that all this is not by the original poet, but has been
&ldquo;inserted at some later period.&rdquo; <a
name="citation91b"></a><a href="#footnote91b"
class="citation">[91b]</a>&nbsp; But, if so, <i>what was the
original ballad before the insertion</i>?&nbsp; As it stands, all
hinges on this impossible refusal of Buccleuch to help his
neighbour and retainer, James Telfer.&nbsp; If Colonel Elliot
excises Buccleuch&rsquo;s refusal of aid as a later
interpolation, and if he allows Telfer to reach Branksome and
receive the aid which Buccleuch would rejoice to give, then the
Elliot version of the ballad cannot take a further step.&nbsp; It
becomes a Scott ballad, Buccleuch sends out his Scotts to pursue
the English raiders, and the Elliots, if they come in at all,
must only be subordinates.&nbsp; But as the Elliot version
stands, it is Buccleuch&rsquo;s refusal to do his duty that
compels poor Jamie to run to his brother-in-law, &ldquo;auld Jock
Grieve&rdquo; in Coultartcleugh, four miles higher on Teviot than
Branksome.&nbsp; Jock gives him a mount, and he rides to
&ldquo;Martin&rsquo;s Hab&rdquo; at &ldquo;Catlockhill,&rdquo; a
place unknown to research thereabout.&nbsp; Thence they both ride
to Martin Elliot at Preakinhaugh, high up in Liddesdale, and the
Elliots under Martin rescue Jamie&rsquo;s kye.</p>
<p>Now the original ballad, if it did not contain
Buccleuch&rsquo;s refusal of aid to Telfer (which refusal is a
thing &ldquo;too absurd to be believed&rdquo;) must merely have
told about the rescue of Jamie&rsquo;s kye by the Scotts, Wat of
Harden, and the rest.&nbsp; If Buccleuch did not refuse help he
gave it, and there was no ride by Telfer to Martin Elliot.&nbsp;
Therefore, without a passage &ldquo;too absurd to be
believed&rdquo; (Buccleuch&rsquo;s refusal), <i>there could be no
Elliots in the story</i>.&nbsp; The alternative is, that Telfer
in Ettrick <i>did</i> pay blackmail to a man so remote as Elliot
of Preakinhaugh, though Buccleuch was his chief and his
neighbour.&nbsp; This is absurd.&nbsp; Yet Colonel Elliot firmly
maintains that the version, in which the Elliots have all the
glory and Buccleuch all the shame, is the original version, and
is true on essential points.</p>
<p>That is only possible if we cut out the verses about Buccleuch
and make an Ettrick man not appeal to him, but go direct to a
Liddesdale man for succour.&nbsp; He must run from Dodhead to
Coultartcleugh, get a horse from Jock Grieve (Buccleuch&rsquo;s
man and tenant), and then ride into Liddesdale to Martin.&nbsp;
But an Ettrick man, in a country of Scotts, would inevitably go
to his chief and neighbour, Buccleuch: it is inconceivable that
he should choose the remote Martin Elliot as his protector, and
go to <i>him</i>.</p>
<p>Thus, as a corollary from Colonel Elliot&rsquo;s own disbelief
in the Buccleuch incident, the Elliot version of the ballad must
be absolutely false and foolish.</p>
<p>If Colonel Elliot leaves in the verses on Buccleuch&rsquo;s
refusal, he leaves in what he calls &ldquo;too absurd to be
believed.&rdquo;&nbsp; If he cuts out these verses as an
interpolation, then Buccleuch lent aid to Telfer, and there was
no occasion to approach Martin Elliot.&nbsp; Or, by a third
course, the Elliot ballad originally made an Ettrick man, a
neighbour of the great Buccleuch, never dream of appealing to
<i>him</i> for help, but run to Coultartcleugh, four miles above
Buccleuch&rsquo;s house, and thence make his way over to distant
Liddesdale to Martin Elliot!&nbsp; Yet Colonel Elliot says that
in what I call &ldquo;the Elliot version,&rdquo; &ldquo;the story
defies criticism.&rdquo; <a name="citation93a"></a><a
href="#footnote93a" class="citation">[93a]</a>&nbsp; Now, however
you take it,&mdash;I give you three choices,&mdash;the story is
absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>This Elliot version was unknown to lovers of the ballads, till
the late Professor Child of Harvard, the greatest master of
British ballad-lore that ever lived, in his beautiful <i>English
and Scottish Popular Ballads</i>, printed it from a manuscript
belonging to Mr. Macmath, which had previously been the property
of a friend of Scott, Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe.&nbsp; This
version is entitled &ldquo;Jamie Telfer <i>in</i> the Fair
Dodhead,&rdquo; not &ldquo;<i>of</i>&rdquo;: Jamie was a tenant
(there was no Jamie Telfer tenant of Dodhead in 1570&ndash;1609,
but concerning that I have more to say).&nbsp; Jamie was no
laird.</p>
<p>Before Professor Child&rsquo;s publication of the Elliot
version, we had only that given by Scott in <i>The Border
Minstrelsy</i> of 1802.&nbsp; Now Scott&rsquo;s version is at
least as absurdly incredible as the Elliot version.&nbsp; In
Scott&rsquo;s version the unhappy Jamie runs, not to Branksome
and Buccleuch, to meet a refusal; but to &ldquo;the Stobs&rsquo;s
Ha&rsquo;&rdquo;(on Slitterick above Hawick) and to &ldquo;auld
Gibby Elliot,&rdquo; the laird.&nbsp; Elliot bids him go to
Branksome and the laird of Buccleuch,</p>
<blockquote><p>For, man, ye never paid money to me!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally Telfer did not pay to Elliot: he paid to Buccleuch,
if to any one.&nbsp; More, till after the Union of 1603, and the
end of Border raids, Gilbert Elliot, a cousin and friend of
Buccleuch, <i>was not the owner of Stobs</i>.&nbsp; The Hon.
George Elliot pointed out this fact in his <i>Border Elliots and
the Family of Minto</i>: Colonel Elliot rightly insists on this
point.</p>
<p>The Scott version is therefore as hopelessly false as the
Elliot version.&nbsp; The Elliot version, with the Buccleuch
incident, is &ldquo;too absurd to be believed,&rdquo; and could
not have been written (except in banter of Buccleuch), while men
remembered the customs of the sixteenth century.&nbsp; The Scott
version, again, could not be composed before the tradition arose
that Gilbert Elliot <i>was</i> laird of Stobs before the Union of
the Crowns in 1603.&nbsp; Now that tradition was in full force on
the Border before 1688.&nbsp; We know that (see chapter on
<i>Kinmont Willie</i>, <i>infra</i>), for, in 1688, a man born in
1613, Captain Walter Scott of Satchells, in his <i>Metrical
History of the Honourable Families of the Names of Scott and
Elliot</i>, represents Gilbert Elliot of Stobs as riding with
Buccleuch in the rescue of Kinmont Willie, in 1596. <a
name="citation95a"></a><a href="#footnote95a"
class="citation">[95a]</a>&nbsp; Now Satchells&rsquo;s own father
rode in that fray, he says, <a name="citation95b"></a><a
href="#footnote95b" class="citation">[95b]</a> and he gives a
minute genealogy of the Elliots of Stobs. <a
name="citation95c"></a><a href="#footnote95c"
class="citation">[95c]</a></p>
<p>Thus the belief that Gilbert Elliot was laird of Stobs by 1596
was current in the traditions of a man born seventeen years after
1596.&nbsp; <i>The Scott version rests on that tradition</i>, and
is not earlier than the rise of that erroneous belief.</p>
<p>Neither the Scott nor Elliot version is other than
historically false.&nbsp; But the Scott version, if we cut out
the reference to auld Gibby Elliot, offers a conceivable, though
not an actual, course of events.&nbsp; The Elliot version, if we
excise the Buccleuch incident, does not.&nbsp; Cutting out the
Buccleuch incident, Telfer goes all the way from Ettrick to
Liddesdale, seeking help in that remote country, and never thinks
of asking aid from Buccleuch, his neighbour and chief.&nbsp; This
is idiotic.&nbsp; In the Scott version, if we cut out the refusal
of Gilbert Elliot of Stobs, Telfer goes straight to his
brother-in-law, auld Jock Grieve, within four miles of Buccleuch
at Branksome; thence to another friend, William&rsquo;s Wat, at
Catslockhill (now Branksome-braes), and so to Buccleuch at
Branksome.&nbsp; This is absurd enough.&nbsp; Telfer would have
gone straight to Branksome and Buccleuch, unless he were a poor
shy small farmer, <i>who wanted sponsors</i>, known to
Buccleuch.&nbsp; Jock Grieve and William&rsquo;s Wat, both of
them retainers and near neighbours of Buccleuch, were such
sponsors.&nbsp; Granting this, the Scott version runs smoothly,
Telfer goes to his sponsors, and with his sponsors to Buccleuch,
and Buccleuch&rsquo;s men rescue his kye.</p>
<h3>III<br />
COLONEL ELLIOT&rsquo;S CHARGE AGAINST SIR WALTER SCOTT</h3>
<p>Colonel Elliot believes generally in the historical character
of the ballad as given in the Elliot version, but &ldquo;is
inclined to think that&rdquo; the original poet &ldquo;never
wrote the stanza&rdquo; (the stanza with Buccleuch&rsquo;s
refusal) &ldquo;at all, and that it has been inserted at some
later period.&rdquo; <a name="citation97a"></a><a
href="#footnote97a" class="citation">[97a]</a>&nbsp; In that case
Colonel Elliot is &ldquo;inclined to think&rdquo; that an Ettrick
farmer, robbed by the English, never dreamed of going to his
neighbour and potent chief, but went all the way to Martin
Elliot, high up in Liddesdale, to seek redress!&nbsp; Surely few
can share the Colonel&rsquo;s inclination.&nbsp; Why should a
farmer in Ettrick &ldquo;choose to lord&rdquo; a remote Elliot,
when he had the Cock of the Border, the heroic Buccleuch, within
eight miles of his home?</p>
<p>Holding these opinions, Colonel Elliot, with deep
regret&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I wat the tear blinded his ee&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>accuses Sir Walter Scott of having taken the Elliot
version&mdash;till then the only version&mdash;and of having
altered stanzas vii.&ndash;xi. (in which Jamie goes to Branksome,
and is refused succour) into his own stanzas vii.&ndash;xi., in
which Jamie goes to Stobs and is refused succour.&nbsp; This evil
thing Scott did, thinks Colonel Elliot.&nbsp; Scott had no copy,
he thinks, of the ballad except an Elliot copy, which he
deliberately perverted.</p>
<p>We must look into the facts of the case.&nbsp; I know no older
published copy of the ballad than that of Scott, in <i>Border
Minstrelsy</i>, vol. i. p. 91 <i>et seqq.</i> (1802).&nbsp;
Professor Child quotes a letter from the Ettrick shepherd to
Scott of &ldquo;June 30, 1802&rdquo; thus: &ldquo;I am surprised
to find that the songs in your collection differ so widely from
my mother&rsquo;s; <i>Jamie Telfer</i> differs in many
particulars.&rdquo; <a name="citation98a"></a><a
href="#footnote98a" class="citation">[98a]</a>&nbsp; (This is an
incomplete quotation.&nbsp; I give the MS. version later.)</p>
<p>Scott himself, before Hogg wrote thus, had said, in the
prefatory note to his <i>Jamie Telfer</i>: &ldquo;There is
another ballad, under the same title as the following, in which
nearly the same incidents are narrated, with little difference,
except that the honour of rescuing the cattle is attributed to
the Liddesdale Elliots, headed by a chief there called Martin
Elliot of the Preakin Tower, whose son, Simm, is said to have
fallen in the action.&nbsp; It is very possible that both the
Teviotdale Scotts and the Elliots were engaged in the affair, and
that each claimed the honour of the victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Hogg&rsquo;s version, &ldquo;differing in many
particulars&rdquo; from Scott&rsquo;s, must have been the Elliot
version, published by Professor Child, as &ldquo;A*,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Jamie Telfer <i>in</i>&rdquo; (not
&ldquo;<i>of</i>&rdquo;) &ldquo;the Fair Dodhead,&rdquo;
&ldquo;from a MS. written about the beginning of the nineteenth
century, and now in the possession of Mr. William Macmath&rdquo;;
it had previously belonged to Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe. <a
name="citation98b"></a><a href="#footnote98b"
class="citation">[98b]</a></p>
<p>There is one great point of difference between the two
forms.&nbsp; In Sir Walter&rsquo;s variant, verse 26 summons the
Scotts of Teviotdale, including Wat of Harden.&nbsp; In his 28
the Scotts ride with the slogan &ldquo;Rise for Branksome
readily.&rdquo;&nbsp; Scott&rsquo;s verses 34, 36, and the two
first lines of 38, are, if there be such a thing as internal
evidence, from his own pen.&nbsp; Such lines as</p>
<blockquote><p>The Dinlay snaw was ne&rsquo;er mair white<br />
Nor the lyart locks o&rsquo; Harden&rsquo;s hair</p>
</blockquote>
<p>are cryingly modern and &ldquo;Scottesque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That Sir Walter knew the other version, as in Mr.
Macmath&rsquo;s MS. of the early nineteenth century, is certain;
he describes that version in his preface.&nbsp; That he effected
the whole transposition of Scotts for Elliots is Colonel
Elliot&rsquo;s opinion. <a name="citation99a"></a><a
href="#footnote99a" class="citation">[99a]</a></p>
<p>If Scott did, I am not the man to defend his conduct; I regret
and condemn it; and shall try to prove that he found the matter
in his copy.&nbsp; I shall first prove, beyond possibility of
doubt, that the ballad is, from end to end, utterly unhistorical,
though based on certain real incidents of 1596&ndash;97.&nbsp; I
shall next show that the Elliot version is probably later than
the Scott version.&nbsp; Finally, I shall make it certain (or so
it seems to me) that Scott worked on an old copy which was
<i>not</i> the copy that belonged to Kirkpatrick Sharpe, but
contained points of difference, <i>not</i> those inserted by Sir
Walter Scott about &ldquo;Dinlay snaw,&rdquo; and so forth.</p>
<h3>IV<br />
WHO WAS THE FARMER IN THE DODHEAD IN 1580&ndash;1609?</h3>
<p>Colonel Elliot has made no attempt to prove that one Telfer
was tenant of the Dodhead in 1580&ndash;1603, which must, we
shall see, include the years in which the alleged incidents
occur.&nbsp; On this question&mdash;was there a Telfer in the
Dodhead in 1580&ndash;1603?&mdash;I consulted my friend, Mr. T.
Craig Brown, author of an excellent <i>History of
Selkirkshire</i>.&nbsp; In that work (vol. i. p. 356) the author
writes: &ldquo;Dodhead or Scotsbank; Dodhead was one of the four
stedes of Redefurd in 1455.&nbsp; In 1609 Robert Scot of
Satchells (ancestor of the poet-captain) obtained a Crown charter
of the lands of Dodbank.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the statement that
Dodhead was one of the three stedes in 1455, Mr. Craig Brown
quotes &ldquo;The Retoured Extent of 1628,&rdquo; &ldquo;an
unimpeachable authority.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the Crown charter of
1609, we have only to look up &ldquo;Dodbank&rdquo; in the
Register of the Great Seal of 1609.&nbsp; The charter is of
November 24, 1609, and gratifies &ldquo;Robert Scott of
Satscheillis&rdquo; (father of the Captain Walter Scott who
composed the <i>Metrical History</i> of the Scotts in 1688) with
the lands, which have been occupied by him and his forefathers
&ldquo;from a time past human memory.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus, writes
Mr. Craig Brown to me, &ldquo;Scott of Satchells was undoubtedly
Scott of <i>Dodhead</i> also in 1609.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In &ldquo;The Retoured Extent of 1628,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>Dodhead</i> or Dodbank&rdquo; appears as Harden&rsquo;s
property.&nbsp; Thus in 1628 the place was &ldquo;Dodhead or
Dodbank,&rdquo; a farm that had been tenanted by Scotts
&ldquo;from beyond human memory.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Mr. Craig Brown
proves from record that one Simpson farmed it in 1510.</p>
<p>So where does Jamie Telfer come in?</p>
<p>The farmers were Scotts, it was to their chief, Buccleuch,
that they went when they needed aid. <a
name="citation101a"></a><a href="#footnote101a"
class="citation">[101a]</a></p>
<p>Thus vanishes the hero of the ballad, <i>Jamie Telfer in the
Fair Dodhead</i>, and thus the ballad is pure fiction from end to
end.</p>
<h3>V<br />
MORE IMPOSSIBILITIES IN THE BALLAD</h3>
<p>This is only one of the impossibilities in the ballad.&nbsp;
That the Captain of Bewcastle, an English hold, stated in a
letter of the period to be distant three miles from the frontier,
the Liddel water, should seek &ldquo;to drive a prey&rdquo; from
the Ettrick, far through the bounds of his neighbours and foes,
Grahams, Armstrongs, Scotts, and Elliots, is a ridiculously
absurd circumstance.</p>
<p>Colonel Elliot attempts to meet this difficulty by his theory
of the route taken by the Captain, which he illustrates by a map.
<a name="citation102a"></a><a href="#footnote102a"
class="citation">[102a]</a>&nbsp; The ballad gives no details
except that the Captain found his first guide &ldquo;high up in
Hardhaughswire,&rdquo; which Colonel Elliot cannot
identify.&nbsp; The second guide was &ldquo;laigh down in
Borthwick water.&rdquo;&nbsp; If this means on the lower course
of the Borthwick, the Captain was perilously near Branksome Hall
and Harden, and his ride was foolhardy.&nbsp; But &ldquo;laigh
down,&rdquo; I think, means merely &ldquo;on lower ground than
Hardhaughswire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain, as soon as he crossed the Ritterford after
leaving Bewcastle, was in hostile and very watchful Armstrong
country.&nbsp; This initial difficulty Colonel Elliot meets by
marking on his map, as Armstrong country, the north bank of the
Liddel down to Kershope burn; and the Captain crosses Liddel
below that burn at Ritterford.&nbsp; Thence he goes north by
west, across Tarras water, up Ewes water, up Mickledale burn, by
Merrylaw and Ramscleugh and so on to Howpasley, which is not on
the lower but the upper Borthwick.</p>
<p>Looking at Colonel Elliot&rsquo;s chart of the Captain&rsquo;s
route, all seems easy enough for the Captain.&nbsp; He does not
try to ride into Teviotdale, for which he is making, up the
Liddel water, and thence by the Hermitage tributary on his
left.&nbsp; Colonel Elliot studs that region with names of
Armstrong and Elliot strongholds.&nbsp; He makes the Captain,
crossing Liddel by the Ritterford, bear to his left, through a
space empty of hostile habitations, in his map.&nbsp; This seems
prudent, but the region thus left blank was full of the fiercest
and most warlike of the Armstrong name.&nbsp; That road was
closed to the Captain!</p>
<p>Colonel Elliot has failed to observe this fact, which I go on
to prove, from a memoir addressed in 1583 to Burleigh, by Thomas
Musgrave, the active son of the aged Captain of Bewcastle, Sir
Simon Musgrave.&nbsp; Thomas describes the topography of the
Middle Marches.&nbsp; He says that the Armstrongs hold both banks
of Liddel as far south as &ldquo;Kershope foot&rdquo; (the
junction of the Kershope with the Liddel), and hold the north
side of the Liddel as far as its junction with the Esk. <a
name="citation103a"></a><a href="#footnote103a"
class="citation">[103a]</a>&nbsp; Thus on crossing Liddel by the
Ritterford, the Captain had at once to pass through the hostile
Armstrongs.&nbsp; Thereby also were Grahams with whom the
Musgraves of Bewcastle were in deadly feud.&nbsp; Farther down
Esk, west of Esk, dwelt Kinmont Willie, an Armstrong, &ldquo;at a
place called Morton.&rdquo;&nbsp; If he did pass so far through
Armstrongs, the Captain met them again, farther north, on Tarras
side, where Runyen Armstrong lived at Thornythaite.&nbsp; Near
him was Armstrong of Hollhouse, Musgrave&rsquo;s great
enemy.&nbsp; North of Tarras the Captain rode through Ewesdale;
there he had to deal with three hundred Armstrong men of the
spear. <a name="citation104a"></a><a href="#footnote104a"
class="citation">[104a]</a>&nbsp; When he reached Ramscleuch
(which he never could have done), the Colonel&rsquo;s map makes
the Captain ride past Ramscleuch, then farmed by the Grieves,
retainers of Buccleuch, who would warn Branksome.&nbsp; When the
Captain reached Howpasley on Borthwick water, he would be
observed by the men of Scott of Howpasley, the Grieves, who could
send a rider some six miles to warn Branksome.</p>
<p>We get the same information as to the perils of the
Captain&rsquo;s path from the places marked on Blaeu&rsquo;s map
of 1600&ndash;54.&nbsp; There are Hollhouse and Thornythaite,
Armstrong towers, and the active John Armstrong of Langholm can
come at a summons.</p>
<p>It seems to be a great error to suppose that the route chosen
for the Captain by Colonel Elliot could lead him into anything
better than a death-trap.&nbsp; I must insist that it would have
been madness for a Captain of Bewcastle to ride far through
Armstrong country, deep into Buccleuch&rsquo;s country, and
return on another line through Scott, and near Elliot, and
through Armstrong country&mdash;and all for no purpose but to
steal ten cows in remote Selkirkshire!</p>
<p>Here I may save the reader trouble, by omitting a great mass
of detail as to the deplorable condition of Bewcastle itself in
1580&ndash;96.&nbsp; Sir Simon, the Captain, declares himself old
and weary.&nbsp; The hold is &ldquo;utterly decayed,&rdquo; the
riders are only thirty-seven men fairly equipped.&nbsp; Soldiers
are asked for, sometimes fifty are sent from the garrison of
Berwick, then they are withdrawn.&nbsp; Bewcastle is forayed
almost daily; &ldquo;March Bills&rdquo; minutely describe the
cattle, horses, and personal property taken from the Captain and
the people by the Armstrongs and Elliots.</p>
<p>Once, in 1582, Thomas Musgrave slew Arthur Graham, a near
neighbour, and took one hundred and sixty kye, but this only
caused such a feud that the Musgraves could not stir safely from
home.&nbsp; From 1586 onwards, Thomas Musgrave, officially or
unofficially, was acting Captain of Bewcastle.&nbsp; He had no
strength to justify him in raiding to remote Ettrick, through
enemies who penned him in at Bewcastle.</p>
<p>I look on Musgrave as the Captain whose existence is known to
the ballad-maker, and I find the origin of the tale of his defeat
and capture in the ballad, in a distorted memory of his actual
capture.</p>
<p>On 3rd July 1596, Thomas (having got Scrope&rsquo;s
permission, without which he dared not cross the Border on
affairs of war) attempted a retaliatory raid on Armstrongs within
seven miles of the Border, the Armstrongs of Hollace, or
Hollhouse.&nbsp; &ldquo;He found only empty houses;&rdquo; he
&ldquo;sought a prey&rdquo; in vain; he let his men straggle, and
returning homeward, with some fifteen companions, he was ambushed
by the Armstrongs near Bewcastle, was refused shelter by a
Graham, was taken prisoner, and was sent to Buccleuch at
Branksome.&nbsp; On 15th July he came home under a bond of
&pound;200 for ransom. <a name="citation106a"></a><a
href="#footnote106a" class="citation">[106a]</a>&nbsp; As every
one did, in his circumstances, the Captain made out his Bill for
Damages.&nbsp; It was indented on 28th April 1597.&nbsp; We learn
that John (Armstrong) of Langholm, Will of Kinmont (not
Liddesdale men), and others, who took him, are in the
Captain&rsquo;s debt for &ldquo;24 horses and mares, himself
prisoner, and ransomed to &pound;200, and 16 other prisoners, and
slaughter.&rdquo;&nbsp; The charges are admitted by the accused;
the Captain is to get &pound;400. <a name="citation106b"></a><a
href="#footnote106b" class="citation">[106b]</a></p>
<p>In my opinion this capture of the Captain of Bewcastle and
others, poetically handled, is, with other incidents, the basis
of the ballad.&nbsp; Colonel Elliot says that the incident
&ldquo;is no proof that a Captain of Bewcastle was not also taken
or killed at some other place or at some other time.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But <i>what</i> Captain, and when?&nbsp; Sir Simon, in 1586, had
been Captain, he says, for thirty years.&nbsp; Thenceforth till
near the Union of the Crowns, Thomas was Captain, or acting
Captain.</p>
<p>So considerable an event as the taking of a Captain of
Bewcastle, who, in the ballad, was shot through the head and
elsewhere, could not escape record in dispatches, and the
periodical &ldquo;March Bills,&rdquo; or statements of wrongs to
be redressed.&nbsp; Colonel Elliot&rsquo;s reply takes the shape
of the argument that the ballad may speak of some other Captain,
at some other time; and that, in one way or another, the
sufferings and losses of <i>that</i> Captain may have escaped
mention in the English dispatches from the Border.&nbsp; These
dispatches are full of minute details, down to the theft of a
single mare.&nbsp; I am content to let historians familiar with
the dispatches decide as to whether the Captain&rsquo;s mad ride
into Ettrick, with his dangerous wounds, loss of property, and
loss of seventeen men killed and wounded (as in the ballad),
could escape mention.</p>
<p>The capture of Thomas Musgrave, I think, and two other
incidents,&mdash;confused in course of tradition, and handled by
the poet with poetic freedom,&mdash;are the materials of <i>Jamie
Telfer</i>.&nbsp; One of the other incidents is of April 1597. <a
name="citation107a"></a><a href="#footnote107a"
class="citation">[107a]</a>&nbsp; Here Buccleuch in person, on
the Sabbath, burned twenty houses in Tynedale, and &ldquo;slew
fourteen men who had been in Scotland and brought away their
booty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here we have Buccleuch &ldquo;on the hot
trod,&rdquo; pursuing English reivers, recovering the spoils
probably, and slaying as many of the raiders as the Captain lost,
in the ballad.&nbsp; Again, not a <i>son</i> of Elliot of
Preakinhaugh (as I had erroneously said), but a <i>nephew</i>
named Martin, was slain in a Tynedale raid into Liddesdale. <a
name="citation108a"></a><a href="#footnote108a"
class="citation">[108a]</a>&nbsp; Soldiers aided the English
raiders.&nbsp; A confused memory of this death of Elliot&rsquo;s
nephew in 1597 may be the source of the story of the death of his
son, Simmy, in the ballad.</p>
<p>Our traditional ballads all arise out of some germs of
history, all handle the facts romantically, and all appear to
have been composed, in their extant shapes, at a considerable
time after the events.&nbsp; I may cite <i>Mary Hamilton</i>;
<i>The Laird of Logie</i> is another case in point; there are
many others.</p>
<p>Colonel Elliot does not agree with me.&nbsp; So be it.</p>
<p>Colonel Elliot writes that,&mdash;in place of my saying that
<i>Jamie Telfer</i> &ldquo;is a mere mythical perversion of
carefully recorded facts,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;it would surely be
more correct to say that it is a fairly true, though jumbled,
account of actual incidents, separated from each other by only
short periods of time . . . &rdquo; <a name="citation108b"></a><a
href="#footnote108b" class="citation">[108b]</a>&nbsp; If he
means, or thinks that I mean, that the actual facts were the
capture of Musgrave near Bewcastle in 1596 by the Armstrongs,
with Buccleuch&rsquo;s hot-trod, and Martin Elliot&rsquo;s
slaying in 1597, I entirely agree with him that the facts are
&ldquo;jumbled.&rdquo;&nbsp; But as to the opinion that the
ballad is &ldquo;fairly true&rdquo; about the raid to Ettrick
(the Captain could not ride a mile beyond the Border without the
Warden&rsquo;s permission), about the non-existent Jamie Telfer,
about the shooting, taking, and plundering of the Captain, about
his loss of seventeen men wounded and slain (he lost about as
many prisoners),&mdash;I have given reasons for my disbelief.</p>
<h3>VI<br />
IS THE SCOTT VERSION, WITH ELLIOTS AND SCOTTS TRANSPOSED, THE
LATER VERSION?</h3>
<p>We now come to the important question, Is the Scott version of
the ballad (apart from Sir Walter&rsquo;s decorative stanzas)
necessarily <i>later</i> than the Elliot version in
Sharpe&rsquo;s copy?&nbsp; The chief argument for the lateness of
the Scott version, the presence of a Gilbert Elliot of Stobs at a
date when this gentleman had not yet acquired Stobs, I have
already treated.&nbsp; If the ballad is no earlier than the date
when Elliot was believed (as by Satchells) to have obtained Stobs
before 1596, the argument falls to the ground.</p>
<p>Starting from that point, and granting that a minstrel fond of
the Scotts wants to banter the Elliots, he may make Telfer ask
aid at Stobs.&nbsp; After that, which version is better in its
topography?&nbsp; Bidden by Stobs to seek Buccleuch, Telfer runs
to Teviot, to Coultartcleugh, some four miles above
Branksome.&nbsp; Branksome was nearer, but Telfer was shy, let us
say, and did not know Buccleuch; while at Coultartcleugh, Jock
Grieve was his brother-in-law.&nbsp; Jock gives him a mount, and
takes him to &ldquo;Catslockhill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, no Catslockhill is known anywhere, to me or to Colonel
Elliot.&nbsp; Mr. Henderson, in a note to the ballad, <a
name="citation110a"></a><a href="#footnote110a"
class="citation">[110a]</a> speaks of &ldquo;Catslack in
Branxholm,&rdquo; and cites the <i>Register of the Privy Seal</i>
for 4th June 1554, and the <i>Register of the Privy Council</i>
for 14th October 1592.&nbsp; The records are full of <i>that</i>
Catslack, but it is not in Branksome.&nbsp; Blaeu&rsquo;s map
(1600&ndash;54) gives it, with its appurtenances, on the north
side of St. Mary&rsquo;s Loch.&nbsp; There is a Catslack on the
north side of Yarrow, near Ladhope, on the southern side.&nbsp;
Neither Catslack is the Catslockhill of the Scott ballad.&nbsp;
But on evidence, &ldquo;and it is good evidence,&rdquo; says
Colonel Elliot, <a name="citation110b"></a><a
href="#footnote110b" class="citation">[110b]</a> I prove that, in
1802, a place called &ldquo;Catlochill&rdquo; existed between
Coultartcleugh and Branksome.&nbsp; The place (Mrs. Grieve,
Branksome Park, informs me) is now called Branksome-braes.&nbsp;
On his copy of <i>The Minstrelsy</i> of 1802, Mr. Grieve, then
tenant of Branksome Park, made a marginal note.&nbsp; Catlochill
was still known to him; it was in a commanding site, and had been
strengthened by the art of man.&nbsp; His note I have seen and
read.</p>
<p>Thus, on good evidence, there was a Catlochill, or
Catlockhill, between Coultartcleugh and Branksome.&nbsp; The
Scott version is right in its topography.</p>
<p>This fact was unknown to Colonel Elliot.&nbsp; Not knowing a
Catslackhill or Catslockhill in Teviot, he made Scott&rsquo;s
Telfer go to an apocryphal Catlockhill in Liddesdale.&nbsp;
Professor Veitch had said that the Catslockhill of the ballad
&ldquo;<i>is to be sought</i>&rdquo; in some locality between
Coultartcleugh and Branxholm.&nbsp; Colonel Elliot calls this
&ldquo;a really preposterously cool suggestion.&rdquo; <a
name="citation111a"></a><a href="#footnote111a"
class="citation">[111a]</a>&nbsp; Why &ldquo;really
preposterously cool&rdquo;?&nbsp; Being sought, the place is
found where it had always been.&nbsp; Jamie Telfer found it, and
in it his friend &ldquo;William&rsquo;s Wat,&rdquo; who took him
to the laird of Buccleuch at Branksome.</p>
<p>In the Elliot version, when refused aid by Buccleuch, Jamie
ran to Coultartcleugh,&mdash;as in Scott&rsquo;s,&mdash;on his
way to Martin Elliot at Preakinhaugh on the Liddel.&nbsp; Jamie
next &ldquo;takes the fray&rdquo; to &ldquo;the
Catlockhill,&rdquo; and is there remounted by
&ldquo;Martin&rsquo;s Hab,&rdquo; an Elliot (not by
William&rsquo;s Wat), and <i>they</i> &ldquo;take the fray&rdquo;
to Martin Elliot at Preakinhaugh in Liddesdale.&nbsp; This is
very well, but where <i>is</i> this &ldquo;Catlockhill&rdquo; in
Liddesdale?&nbsp; Is it even a real place?</p>
<p>Colonel Elliot has found no such place; nor can I find it in
the <i>Registrum Magni Sigilli</i>, nor in Blaeu&rsquo;s map of
1600&ndash;54.</p>
<p>Colonel Elliot&rsquo;s argument has been that the Elliot
version, the version of the Sharpe MS., is the earlier, for,
among other reasons, its topography is correct. <a
name="citation112a"></a><a href="#footnote112a"
class="citation">[112a]</a>&nbsp; It makes Telfer run from
Dodhead to Branksome for aid, because that was the comparatively
near residence of the powerful Buccleuch.&nbsp; Told by Buccleuch
to seek aid from Martin Elliot in Liddesdale, Telfer does
so.&nbsp; He runs up Teviot four miles to his brother-in-law,
Jock Grieve, who mounts him.&nbsp; He then rides off at a right
angle, from Teviot to Catlockhill, says the Elliot ballad, where
he is rehorsed by Martin&rsquo;s Hab.&nbsp; The pair then take
the fray to Martin Elliot at Preakinhaugh on Liddel water, and
Martin summons and leads the pursuers of the Captain.</p>
<p>This, to Colonel Elliot&rsquo;s mind, is all plain sailing,
all is feasible and natural.&nbsp; And so it <i>is</i> feasible
and natural, if Colonel Elliot can find a Catlockhill anywhere
between Coultartcleugh and Preakinhaugh.&nbsp; On that line, in
Mr. Veitch&rsquo;s words, Catlockhill &ldquo;is to be
sought.&rdquo;&nbsp; But just as Mr. Veitch could find no
Catslockhill between Coultartcleugh and Branksome, so Colonel
Elliot can find no Catlockhill between Coultartcleugh and
Preakinhaugh.&nbsp; He tells us <a name="citation112b"></a><a
href="#footnote112b" class="citation">[112b]</a> indeed of
&ldquo;Catlockhill on Hermitage water.&rdquo;&nbsp; But there is
no such place known!&nbsp; Colonel Elliot&rsquo;s method is to
take a place which, he says, is given as &ldquo;Catlie&rdquo;
Hill, &ldquo;between Dinlay burn and Hermitage water, on
Blaeu&rsquo;s map of 1654.&rdquo;&nbsp; We may murmur that Catlie
Hill is one thing and Catlock another, but Colonel Elliot points
out that &ldquo;lock&rdquo; means &ldquo;the meeting of
waters,&rdquo; and that Catlie Hill is near the meeting of Dinlay
burn and the Hermitage water.&nbsp; But then why does Blaeu call
it, not Catlockhill, nor Catlie hill, nor &ldquo;Catlie&rdquo;
even, but &ldquo;<i>Gatlie</i>,&rdquo; for so it is distinctly
printed on my copy of the map?&nbsp; Really we cannot take a
place called &ldquo;Gatlie Hill&rdquo; and pronounce that we have
found &ldquo;Catlockhill&rdquo;!&nbsp; Would Colonel Elliot have
permitted Mr. Veitch&mdash;if Mr. Veitch had found &ldquo;Gatlie
Hill&rdquo; near Branksome, in Blaeu&mdash;to aver that he had
found Catslockhill near Branksome?</p>
<p>Thus, till Colonel Elliot produces on good evidence a
Catlockhill between Coultartcleugh and Preakinhaugh, the
topography of the Elliot ballad, of the Sharpe copy of the
ballad, is nowhere, for neither Catliehill nor Gatliehill is
Catlockhill.&nbsp; That does not look as if the Elliot were older
than the Scott version.&nbsp; (There was a Sim <i>Armstrong</i>
of the <i>Cathill</i>, slain by a Ridley of Hartswell in 1597. <a
name="citation113a"></a><a href="#footnote113a"
class="citation">[113a]</a>)</p>
<p>We now take the Scott version where Telfer has arrived at
Branksome.&nbsp; Scott&rsquo;s stanza xxv. is Sharpe&rsquo;s
xxiv.&nbsp; In Scott, Buccleuch; in Sharpe, Martin Elliot bids
his men &ldquo;warn the waterside&rdquo; (Sharpe), &ldquo;warn
the water braid and wide&rdquo; (Scott).&nbsp; Scott&rsquo;s
stanza xxvi. is probably his own, or may be, for he bids them
warn Wat o&rsquo; Harden, Borthwick water, and the Teviot Scotts,
and Gilmanscleuch&mdash;which is remote.&nbsp; Then, in xxvii.,
Buccleuch says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Ride by the gate of Priesthaughswire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And warn the Currors o&rsquo; the Lee,<br />
As ye come down the Hermitage slack<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Warn doughty Wiliie o&rsquo; Gorrinberry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this is plain sailing, by the pass of Priesthaughswire the
Scotts will ride from Teviot into Hermitage water, and, near the
Slack, they will pass Gorrinberry, will call Will, and gallop
down Hermitage water to the Liddel, where they will nick the
returning Captain at the Ritterford.</p>
<p>The Sharpe version makes Martin order the warning of the
waterside (xxiv.), and then Martin says (xxv.)&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>When ye come in at the Hermitage Slack,<br />
Warn doughty Will o&rsquo; Gorranherry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Colonel Elliot <a name="citation114a"></a><a
href="#footnote114a" class="citation">[114a]</a> supposes Martin
(if I follow his meaning) to send Simmy with his command, <i>back
over all the course that Telfer and Martin&rsquo;s Hab have
already ridden</i>: back past Shaws, near Braidley (a house of
Martin&rsquo;s), past &ldquo;Catlockhill,&rdquo; to Gorranberry,
to &ldquo;warn the waterside.&rdquo;&nbsp; But surely Telfer, who
passed Gorranberry gates, and with Hab passed the other places,
had &ldquo;taken the fray,&rdquo; and warned the water quite
sufficiently already.&nbsp; If this be granted, the Sharpe
version is taking from the Scott version the stanza, so natural
there, about the Hermitage Slack and Gorranberry.&nbsp; But
Colonel Elliot infers, from stanzas xxvi., xxx., xxxi., that
Simmy has warned the water as far as Gorranberry (<i>again</i>),
has come in touch with the Captain, &ldquo;between the Frostily
and the Ritterford,&rdquo; and that this is &ldquo;consistent
only with his having moved up the Hermitage water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Martin, he thinks, rode with his men down Liddel
water.&nbsp; But here we get into a maze of topographical
conjecture, including the hypothesis that perhaps the Liddel came
down in flood, and caused the English to make for Kershope ford
instead of Ritterford, and here they were met by Martin&rsquo;s
men on the Hermitage line of advance.&nbsp; I cannot find this
elegant combined movement in the ballad; all this seems to me
hypothesis upon hypothesis, even granting that Martin sent Simmy
back up Hermitage that he might thence cut sooner across the
enemy&rsquo;s path.&nbsp; Colonel Elliot himself writes:
&ldquo;It is certain that after the news of the raid reached
Catlockhill&rdquo; (<i>and</i> Gorranberry, Telfer passed it),
&ldquo;it must have spread rapidly through Hermitage water, and
it is most unlikely for the men of this district to have delayed
taking action until they received instructions from their
chief.&rdquo; <a name="citation115"></a><a href="#footnote115"
class="citation">[115]</a></p>
<p>That is exactly what I say; but Martin says, &ldquo;When ye
come in at the Hermitage Slack, warn doughty Will o&rsquo;
Gorranberry.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why go to warn him, when, as Colonel
Elliot says, the news is running through Hermitage water, and the
men are most probably acting on it,&mdash;as they certainly would
do?</p>
<p>Martin&rsquo;s orders, in Sharpe xxv., are taken, I think,
from Buccleuch&rsquo;s, in Scott&rsquo;s xxvii.</p>
<p>The point is that Martin had no need to warn men so far away
as Gorranberry,&mdash;they were roused already.&nbsp; Yet he
orders them to be warned, and about a combined movement of Martin
and Simmy on different lines the ballad says not a word.&nbsp;
All this is inference merely, inference not from historical
facts, but from what may be guessed to have been in the mind of
the poet.</p>
<p>Thus the Elliot or Sharpe version has topography that will not
hold water, while the Scott topography does hold water; and the
Elliot song seems to borrow the lines on the Hermitage Slack and
Gorranberry from a form of the Scott version.&nbsp; This being
the case, the original version on which Scott worked is earlier
than the Elliot version.&nbsp; In the Scott version the rescuers
must come down the Hermitage Slack: in the Elliot they have no
reason for riding <i>back</i> to that place.</p>
<h3>VII<br />
SCOTT HAD A COPY OF THE BALLAD WHICH WAS NOT THE SHARPE COPY</h3>
<p>Did Scott know no other version than that of the Sharpe
MS.?&nbsp; In Scott&rsquo;s version, stanza xlix., the last, is
absent from the Elliot version, which concludes triumphantly,
thus&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Now on they came to the fair Dodhead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They were a welcome sight to see,<br />
And instead of his ain ten milk-kye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Jamie Telfer&rsquo;s gotten thirty and three.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scott too gives this, but ends with a verse not in
Sharpe&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>And he has paid the rescue shot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Baith wi&rsquo; goud and white money,<br />
And at the burial o&rsquo; Willie Scott<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I wat was mony a weeping ee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did Scott add this?&nbsp; Proof is impossible; but the verse
is so prosaic, and so injurious to the triumphant preceding
verse, that I think Scott found it in his copy: in which case he
had another copy than Sharpe&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Scott (stanza xviii.) reads &ldquo;Catslockhill&rdquo; where
the Sharpe MS. reads &ldquo;Catlockhill.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
Scott&rsquo;s time it was a mound, but the name was then known to
Mr. Grieve, the tenant of Branksome Park.&nbsp; To-day I cannot
find the mound; is it likely that Scott, before making the
change, sought diligently for the mound and its name?&nbsp; If
so, he found &ldquo;<i>Catlochill</i>,&rdquo; for so Mr. Grieve
writes it, not Catslockhill.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Colonel Elliot, we know, has no Catlockhill where he
wants it; he has only Gatliehill, unless his Blaeu varies from my
copy, and Gatliehill is not Catlockhill.</p>
<p>Scott gives (xlviii.) the speech of the Captain after he is
shot through the head and in another dangerous part of his
frame&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hae back thy kye!&rdquo; the Captain
said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear kye, I trow, to some they be,<br />
For gin I suld live a hundred years,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There will ne&rsquo;er fair lady smile on
me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not in Sharpe&rsquo;s MS., and I attribute this
redundant stanza to Scott&rsquo;s copy.&nbsp; The Captain,
remember, has a shot &ldquo;through his head,&rdquo; and another
which must have caused excruciating torture.&nbsp; In these
circumstances would a poet like Scott put in his mouth a speech
which merely reiterates the previous verse?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; But
the verse was in Scott&rsquo;s copy.</p>
<p>Colonel Elliot has himself noted a more important point than
these: he quotes Scott&rsquo;s stanza xii., which is absent from
the Sharpe MS.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>My hounds may a&rsquo; rin masterless,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My hawks may fly frae tree to tree,<br />
My lord may grip my vassal lands,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For there again maun I never be!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;They are, doubtless, beautiful lines, but their very
beauty jars like a false note.&nbsp; One feels they were written
by another hand, by an artist of a higher stamp than a Border
&lsquo;ballad-maker.&rsquo;&nbsp; And not only is it their beauty
that jars, but so also does their inapplicability to Jamie Telfer
and to the circumstances in which he found himself&mdash;so much
so, indeed, that it may well occur to one that the stanza belongs
to some other ballad, and has accidentally been pitchforked into
this one.&nbsp; It would not have been out of place in the ballad
of <i>The Battle of Otterbourne</i>, and, indeed, it bears some
resemblance to a stanza in that ballad.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here the
Colonel says that the lines &ldquo;one feels were written by
another hand, by an artist of a higher stamp than a Border
ballad-maker.&rdquo;&nbsp; But &ldquo;it may also occur to one
that the stanza belongs to some other ballad, and has
<i>accidentally</i>&rdquo; (my italics) &ldquo;been pitchforked
into this&rdquo;: a very sound inference.</p>
<p>Now if Scott had only the Sharpe version, he was the last man
to &ldquo;pitchfork&rdquo; into it, &ldquo;accidentally,&rdquo; a
stanza from &ldquo;some other ballad,&rdquo; that stanza being as
Colonel Elliot says &ldquo;inapplicable&rdquo; to Telfer and his
circumstances.&nbsp; Poor Jamie, a small tenant-farmer, with ten
cows, and, as far as we learn, not one horse, had no hawks and
hounds; no &ldquo;vassal lands,&rdquo; and no reason to say that
at the Dodhead he &ldquo;maun never be again.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
could return from his long run!&nbsp; Scott certainly did not
compose these lines; and he could not have pitchforked them into
<i>Jamie Telfer</i>, either by accident or design.</p>
<p>Professor Child remarked on all this: &ldquo;Stanza xii. is
not only found elsewhere (compare <i>Young Beichan</i>, E vi.),
but could not be more inappropriately brought in than here;
Scott, however, is not responsible for that.&rdquo; <a
name="citation120a"></a><a href="#footnote120a"
class="citation">[120a]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The hawk that flies from tree to tree</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is a formula; it comes in the Kinloch MS. copy of the ballad
of <i>Jamie Douglas</i>, date about 1690.</p>
<p>I know no proof that Scott was acquainted with variant E of
<i>Young Beichan</i>. <a name="citation120b"></a><a
href="#footnote120b" class="citation">[120b]</a>&nbsp; If he had
been, he could not have introduced into <i>Jamie Telfer</i> lines
so utterly out of keeping with Telfer&rsquo;s circumstances, as
Colonel Elliot himself says that stanza xii. is.&nbsp; It may be
argued, &ldquo;if Scott <i>did</i> find stanza xii. in his copy,
it was in his power to cut it out; he treated his copies as he
pleased.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is true, but my position is that, of
the two, Scott is more likely to have let the stanza abide where
he found it (as he did with his MS. of <i>Tamlane</i>, retaining
its absurdities) in his copy, than to &ldquo;pitchfork it
in,&rdquo; from an obscure variant of <i>Young Beichan</i>, which
we cannot prove that he had ever heard or read.&nbsp; But as we
can never tell that Scott did <i>not</i> know any rhyme, we ask,
why did he &ldquo;pitchfork in&rdquo; the stanza, where it was
quite out of place?&nbsp; Child absolves him from this
absurdity.</p>
<p>Thus Scott had before him another than the Sharpe copy; had a
copy containing stanza xii.&nbsp; That copy presented the
perversion&mdash;the transposition of Scott&rsquo;s and
Elliot&rsquo;s&mdash;and into that copy Scott wrote the stanzas
which bear his modern romantic mark.&nbsp; Colonel Elliot, we
saw, is uncertain whether to attribute stanza xii. to
&ldquo;another hand, an artist of higher stamp than a Border
ballad-maker,&rdquo; or to regard it as belonging &ldquo;to some
other ballad,&rdquo; and as having been &ldquo;accidentally
pitchforked into this one.&rdquo;&nbsp; The stanza is, in fact,
an old floating ballad stanza, attracted into the <i>cantefable
of Susie Pye</i>, and the ballad of <i>Young Beichan</i> (E), and
partly into <i>Jamie Douglas</i>.&nbsp; Thus Scott did not
<i>make</i> the stanza, and we cannot suppose that, if he knew
the stanza in any form, he either &ldquo;accidentally
pitchforked&rdquo; or wilfully inserted into <i>Jamie Telfer</i>
anything so absurdly inappropriate.&nbsp; The inference is that
Scott worked on another copy, not the Sharpe copy.</p>
<p>If Scott had not a copy other than Sharpe&rsquo;s, why should
he alter Sharpe&rsquo;s (vii.)</p>
<blockquote><p>The moon was up and the sun was down,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>into</p>
<blockquote><p>The sun wasna up but the moon was down?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What did he gain by that?&nbsp; <i>Why did he make Jamie</i>
&ldquo;<i>of</i>&rdquo; <i>not</i> &ldquo;<i>in</i>&rdquo; <i>the
Dodhead</i>, <i>if he found</i> &ldquo;<i>in</i>&rdquo; <i>in his
copy</i>?&nbsp; &ldquo;In&rdquo; means &ldquo;tenant in,&rdquo;
&ldquo;of&rdquo; means &ldquo;laird of,&rdquo; as nobody knew
better than Scott.&nbsp; Jamie is evidently no laird, but
&ldquo;of&rdquo; was in Scott&rsquo;s copy.</p>
<p>If the question were about two Greek texts, the learned would
admit that these points in A (Scott) are not derived from B
(Sharpe).&nbsp; Scott&rsquo;s additions have an obvious motive,
they add picturesqueness to his clan.&nbsp; But the differences
which I have noticed do nothing of that kind.&nbsp; When they
affect the poetry they spoil the poetry, when they do not affect
the poetry they are quite motiveless, whence I conclude that
Scott followed his copy in these cases, and that his copy was not
the Sharpe MS.</p>
<p>If I have satisfied the reader on that point I need not touch
on Colonel Elliot&rsquo;s long and intricate argument to prove,
or suggest, that Scott had before him no copy of the ballad
except one supposed by the Colonel to have been taken by James
Hogg from his mother&rsquo;s recitation, while that copy, again,
is supposed to be the Sharpe MS.&mdash;all sheer conjecture. <a
name="citation122a"></a><a href="#footnote122a"
class="citation">[122a]</a>&nbsp; Not that I fear to encounter
Colonel Elliot on this ground, but argufying on it is dull, and
apt to be inconclusive.</p>
<p>In the letter of Hogg to Scott (June 30, 1803) as given by Mr.
Douglas in <i>Familiar Letters</i>, Hogg says, &ldquo;I am
surprised to find that the songs in your collection differ so
widely from my mother&rsquo;s . . . <i>Jamie Telfer</i> differs
in many particulars.&rdquo; <a name="citation123a"></a><a
href="#footnote123a" class="citation">[123a]</a>&nbsp; The marks
of omission were all filled up in Hogg&rsquo;s MS. letter thus:
&ldquo;Is Mr. Herd&rsquo;s MS. genuine?&nbsp; I suspect
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then it runs on, &ldquo;<i>Jamie Telfer</i>
differs in many particulars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I owe this information to the kindness of Mr. Macmath.&nbsp;
What does Hogg mean?&nbsp; Does &ldquo;Is Mr. Herd&rsquo;s MS.
genuine?&rdquo; mean all Herd&rsquo;s MS. copies used by
Scott?&nbsp; Or does it refer to <i>Jamie Telfer</i> in
especial?</p>
<p>Mr. Macmath, who possesses C. K. Sharpe&rsquo;s MS. copy of
the Elliot version, believes that it is Herd&rsquo;s hand as
affected by age.&nbsp; Mr. Macmath and I independently reached
the conclusion that by &ldquo;Mr. Herd&rsquo;s MS.&rdquo; Hogg
meant all Herd&rsquo;s MSS., which Scott quoted in <i>The
Minstrelsy</i> of 1803.&nbsp; Their readings varied from Mrs.
Hogg&rsquo;s; therefore Hogg misdoubted them.&nbsp; He adds that
<i>Jamie Telfer</i> differs from his mother&rsquo;s version,
without meaning that, for <i>Jamie</i>, Scott used a Herd MS.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Conclusion</span></h3>
<p>I have now proved, I hope, that the ballad of <i>Jamie
Telfer</i> is entirely mythical except for a few suggestions
derived from historical events of 1596&ndash;97.&nbsp; I have
shown, and Colonel Elliot agrees, that refusal of aid by
Buccleuch (or by Elliot of Stobs) is impossible, and that the
ballad, if it existed without this incident, must have been a
Scott, and could not be an Elliot ballad.&nbsp; No farmer in
Ettrick would pay protection-money to an Elliot on Liddel, while
he had a Scott at Branksome.&nbsp; I have also disproved the
existence of a <i>Jamie Telfer</i> as farmer at &ldquo;Dodhead or
Dodbank&rdquo; in the late sixteenth century.</p>
<p>As to the character of Sir Walter Scott, I have proved, I
hope, that he worked on a copy of the ballad which was not the
Elliot version, or the Sharpe copy; so that this copy may have
represented the Scotts as taking the leading part; while for the
reasons given, it is apparently earlier than the Elliot
version&mdash;cannot, at least, be proved to be later&mdash;and
is topographically the more correct of the two.&nbsp; I have
given antique examples of the same sort of perversions in
<i>Otterburn</i>.&nbsp; If I am right, Colonel Elliot&rsquo;s
charge against Scott lacks its base&mdash;that Scott knew none
but the Sharpe copy, whence it is inferred that he not only
decorated the song (as is undeniable), but perverted it in a way
far from sportsmanlike.</p>
<p>I may have shaken Colonel Elliot&rsquo;s belief in the
historicity of the ballad.&nbsp; His suspicions of Scott I cannot
hope to remove, and they are very natural suspicions, due to
Scott&rsquo;s method of editing ballads and habit of
&ldquo;giving them a cocked hat and a sword,&rdquo; as he did to
stories which he heard; and repeated, much improved.</p>
<p>Absolute proof that Scott did, or did not, pervert the ballad,
and turn a false Elliot into a false Scott version, cannot be
obtained unless new documents bearing on the matter are
discovered.</p>
<p>But, I repeat, as may be read in the chapter on <i>The Ballad
of Otterburne</i>, such inversions and perversions of ballads
occurred freely in the sixteenth century, and, in the
seventeenth, the process may have been applied to <i>Jamie
Telfer</i>. <a name="citation125a"></a><a href="#footnote125a"

126</span>KINMONT WILLIE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> there be, in <i>The Border
Minstrelsy</i>, a ballad which is still popular, or, at least, is
still not forgotten, it is <i>Kinmont Willie</i>.&nbsp; This hero
was an Armstrong, and one of the most active of that unbridled
clan.&nbsp; He was taken prisoner, contrary to Border law, on a
day of &ldquo;Warden&rsquo;s Truce,&rdquo; by Salkeld of Corby on
the Eden, deputy of Lord Scrope, the English Warden; and, despite
the written remonstrances of Buccleuch, he was shut up in
Carlisle Castle.&nbsp; Diplomacy failing, Buccleuch resorted to
force, and, by a sudden and daring march, he surprised Carlisle
Castle, rescued Willie, and returned to Branksome.&nbsp; The date
of the rescue is 13th April 1596.&nbsp; The dispatches of the
period are full of this event, and of the subsequent
negotiations, with which we are not concerned.</p>
<p>The ballad is worthy of the cool yet romantic gallantry of the
achievement.&nbsp; Kinmont Willie was a ruffian, but he had been
unlawfully seized.&nbsp; This was one of many studied insults
passed by Elizabeth&rsquo;s officials on Scotland at that time,
when the English Government, leagued with the furious pulpiteers
of the Kirk, and with Francis Stewart, the wild Earl of Bothwell,
was persecuting and personally affronting James VI.</p>
<p>In Buccleuch, the Warden of the March, England insulted the
man who was least likely to pocket a wrong.&nbsp; Without causing
the loss of an English life, Buccleuch repaid the affront,
recovered the prisoner, broke the strong Castle of Carlisle, made
Scrope ridiculous and Elizabeth frantic.</p>
<p>In addition to <i>Kinmont Willie</i> there survive two other
ballads on rescues of prisoners in similar circumstances.&nbsp;
One is <i>Jock o&rsquo; the Side</i>, of which there is an
English version in the Percy MSS., <i>John a Side</i>.&nbsp;
Scott&rsquo;s version, in <i>The Border Minstrelsy</i>, is from
Caw&rsquo;s <i>Museum</i>, published at Hawick in 1784.&nbsp;
Scott leaves out Caw&rsquo;s last stanza about a
punch-bowl.&nbsp; There are other variations.&nbsp; Four
Armstrongs break into Newcastle Tower.&nbsp; Jock, heavily
ironed, is carried downstairs on the back of one of them; they
ride a river in spait, where the English dare not follow.</p>
<p><i>Archie o&rsquo; Cafield</i>, another rescue, Scott printed
in 1802 from a MS. of Mr. Riddell of Glenriddell, a great
collector, the friend of Burns.&nbsp; He omitted six stanzas, and
&ldquo;made many editorial improvements, besides Scotticising the
spelling.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the edition published after his death
(1833) he &ldquo;has been enabled to add several stanzas from
recitation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Leyden appears to have collected the
copy whence the additional stanzas came; the MS., at Abbotsford,
is in his hand.&nbsp; In this ballad the Halls, noted
freebooters, rescue Archie o&rsquo; Cafield from prison in
Dumfries.&nbsp; As in <i>Jock o&rsquo; the Side</i> and
<i>Kinmont Willie</i>, they speak to their friend, asking how he
sleeps; they carry him downstairs, irons and all, and, as in the
two other ballads, they are pursued, cross a flooded river,
banter the English, and then, in a version in the Percy MSS.,
&ldquo;communicated to Percy by Miss Fisher, 1780,&rdquo; the
English lieutenant says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I think some witch has bore thee, Dicky,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or some devil in hell been thy daddy.<br />
I would not swam that wan water, double-horsed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For a&rsquo; the gold in Christenty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Manifestly here was a form of Lord Scrope&rsquo;s reply to
Buccleuch, in the last stanza of <i>Kinmont Willie</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>He is either himself a devil frae hell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or else his mother a witch may be,<br />
I wadna hae ridden that wan water<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For a&rsquo; the gowd in Christentie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scott writes, in a preface to <i>Archie o&rsquo; Cafield</i>
and <i>Jock o&rsquo; the Side</i>, that there are, with
<i>Kinmont Willie</i>, three ballads of rescues, &ldquo;the
incidents in which nearly resemble each other; though the
poetical description is so different, that the editor did not
feel himself at liberty to reject any one of them, as borrowed
from the others.&nbsp; As, however, there are several verses,
which, in recitation, are common to all these three songs, the
editor, to prevent unnecessary and disagreeable repetition, has
used the freedom of appropriating them to that in which they have
the best poetical effect.&rdquo; <a name="citation129a"></a><a
href="#footnote129a" class="citation">[129a]</a></p>
<p>Consequently the verse quoted from the Percy MS. of <i>Archie
o&rsquo; Cafield</i> may be improved and placed in the lips of
Lord Scrope, in <i>Kinmont Willie</i>.&nbsp; But there is no
evidence that Scott ever saw or even heard of this Percy MS., and
probably he got the verse from recitation.</p>
<p>Now the affair of the rescue of Kinmont Willie was much more
important and resonant than the two other rescues, and was
certain to give rise to a ballad, which would contain much the
same formul&aelig; as the other two.&nbsp; The ballad-maker, like
Homer, always uses a formula if he can find one.&nbsp; But
<i>Kinmont Willie</i> is so much superior to the two others, so
epic in its speed and concentration of incidents, that the
question rises, had Scott even fragments of an original ballad of
the Kinmont, &ldquo;much mangled by reciters,&rdquo; as he
admits, or did he compose the whole?&nbsp; No MS. copies exist at
Abbotsford.&nbsp; There is only one hint.&nbsp; In a list of
twenty-two ballads, pasted into a commonplace book, eleven are
marked X (as if he had obtained them), and eleven others are
unmarked, as if they were still to seek.&nbsp; Unmarked is
<i>Kinmount Willie</i>.</p>
<p>Did he find it, or did he make it all?</p>
<p>In 1888, in a note to <i>Kinmont Willie</i>, I wrote:
&ldquo;There is a prose account very like the ballad in Scott of
Satchells&rsquo; <i>History of the Name of Scott</i>&rdquo;
(1688).&nbsp; Satchells&rsquo; long-winded story is partly in
unrhymed and unmetrical lines, partly in rhymes of various
metres.&nbsp; The man, born in 1613, was old, had passed his life
as a soldier; certainly could not write, possibly could not
read.</p>
<p>Colonel Elliot &ldquo;believes that Sir Walter wrote the whole
from beginning to end, and that it is, in fact, a clever and
extremely beautiful paraphrase of Satchells&rsquo; rhymes.&rdquo;
<a name="citation130a"></a><a href="#footnote130a"
class="citation">[130a]</a></p>
<p>This thorough scepticism is not a novelty, as Colonel Elliot
quotes me I had written years ago, &ldquo;In <i>Kinmont
Willie</i>, Scott has been suspected of making the whole
ballad.&rdquo;&nbsp; I did not, as the Colonel says,
&ldquo;mention the names of the sceptics or the grounds of their
suspicions.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The sceptics,&rdquo; or one of
them, was myself: I had &ldquo;suspected&rdquo; on much the same
grounds as Colonel Elliot&rsquo;s own, and I shall give my
reasons for adopting a more conservative opinion.&nbsp; One
reason is merely subjective.&nbsp; As a man, by long familiarity
with ancient works of art, Greek gems, for example, acquires a
sense of their authenticity, or the reverse, so he does in the
case of ballads&mdash;or thinks he does&mdash;but of course this
result of experience is no ground of argument: experts are often
gulled.&nbsp; The ballad varies in many points from
Satchells&rsquo;, which Colonel Elliot explains thus: &ldquo;I
think that the cause for the narrative at times diverging from
that recorded by the rhymes (of Satchells), is due, partly to
artistic considerations, partly to the author having wished to
bring it more or less into conformity with history.&rdquo; <a
name="citation131a"></a><a href="#footnote131a"
class="citation">[131a]</a></p>
<p>Colonel Elliot quotes Scott&rsquo;s preface to the ballad:
&ldquo;In many things Satchells agrees with the ballads current
in his time&rdquo; (1643&ndash;88), &ldquo;from which in all
probability he derived most of his information as to past events,
and from which he occasionally pirates whole verses, as we
noticed in the annotations upon the <i>Raid of the
Reidswire</i>.&nbsp; In the present instance he mentions the
prisoner&rsquo;s large spurs (alluding to fetters), and some
other little incidents noticed in the ballad, which therefore was
probably well known in his day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Satchells was born in 1613, while the rescue of <i>Kinmont
Willie</i> by Buccleuch, out of Carlisle Castle, was in 1596, and
as Satchells&rsquo; father was in that adventure (or so Satchells
says) he probably knew much about the affair from fresh
tradition.&nbsp; Colonel Elliot notices this, and says:
&ldquo;The probability of Satchells having obtained information
from a hypothetical ballad is really quite an inadmissible
argument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This comes near to begging the question.&nbsp; As contemporary
incidents much less striking and famous than the rescue of
<i>Kinmont Willie</i> were certainly recorded in ballads, the
opinion that there was a ballad of <i>Kinmont Willie</i> is a
legitimate hypothesis, which must be tested on its merits.&nbsp;
For example, we shall ask, Does Satchells&rsquo; version yield
any traces of ballad sources?</p>
<p>My own opinion has been anticipated by Mr. Frank Miller in his
<i>The Poets of Dumfriesshire</i> (p. 33, 1910), and in
ballad-lore Mr. Miller is well equipped.&nbsp; He says:
&ldquo;The balance of probability seems to be in favour of the
originality of <i>Kinmont Willie</i>,&rdquo; rather than of
Satchells (he means, not of our <i>Kinmont Willie</i> as Scott
gives it, but of a ballad concerning the Kinmont).&nbsp;
&ldquo;Captain Walter Scott&rsquo;s&rdquo; (of Satchells)
&ldquo;<i>True History</i> was certainly gathered out of the
ballads current in his day, as well as out of formal histories,
and his account of the assault on the Castle reads like a
narrative largely due to suggestions from some popular
lay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Does Satchells&rsquo; version, then, show traces of a memory
of such a lay?&nbsp; Undoubtedly it does.</p>
<p>Satchells&rsquo; prolix narrative occasionally drops or rises
into ballad lines, as in the opening about Kinmont
Willie&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>It fell about the Martinmas<br />
When kine was in the prime</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that Willie &ldquo;brought a prey out of
Northumberland.&rdquo;&nbsp; The old ballad, disregarding dates,
may well have opened with this common formula.&nbsp; Lord Scrope
vowed vengence:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Took Kinmont the self-same night.</p>
<p>If he had had but ten men more,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That had been as stout as he,<br />
Lord Scroup had not the Kinmont ta&rsquo;en<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With all his company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scott&rsquo;s ballad (stanza i.) says that &ldquo;fause
Sakelde&rdquo; and Scrope took Willie (as in fact Salkeld of
Corby <i>did</i>), and</p>
<blockquote><p>Had Willie had but twenty men,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But twenty men as stout as he,<br />
Fause Sakelde had never the Kinmont ta&rsquo;en,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wi&rsquo; eight score in his cumpanie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Manifestly either Satchells is here &ldquo;pirating&rdquo; a
verse of a ballad (as Scott holds) or Scott, if he had <i>no</i>
ballad fragments before him, is &ldquo;pirating&rdquo; a verse
from Satchells, as Colonel Elliot must suppose.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Satchells had a memory of a Kinmont ballad
beginning like <i>Jamie Telfer</i>, &ldquo;It fell about the
Martinmas tyde,&rdquo; or, like <i>Otterburn</i>, &ldquo;It fell
about the Lammas tide,&rdquo; and he opened with this formula,
broke away from it, and came back to the ballad in the stanza,
&ldquo;If he had had but ten men more,&rdquo; which differs but
slightly from stanza ii. of Scott&rsquo;s ballad.&nbsp; That this
is so, and that, later, Satchells is again reminiscent of a
ballad, is no improbable opinion.</p>
<p>In the ballad (iii.&ndash;viii.) we learn how Willie is
brought a prisoner across Liddel to Carlisle; we have his
altercation with Lord Scrope, and the arrival of the news at
Branksome, where Buccleuch is at table.&nbsp; Satchells also
gives the altercation.&nbsp; In both versions Willie promises to
&ldquo;take his leave&rdquo; of Scrope before he quits the
Castle.</p>
<p>In Scott&rsquo;s ballad (Scrope speaks) (stanza vi.).</p>
<blockquote><p>Before ye cross my castle yate,<br />
I trow ye shall take fareweel o&rsquo; me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Willie replies&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I never yet lodged in a hostelrie,<br />
But I paid my lawing before I gaed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Satchells, Lord Scrope says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Before thou goest away thou must<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Even take thy leave of me?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;By the cross of my sword,&rdquo; says Willie then,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my leave of thee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, had Scott been pirating Satchells, I think he would have
kept &ldquo;By the cross of my sword,&rdquo; which is picturesque
and probable, Willie being no good Presbyterian.&nbsp; In
<i>Otterburne</i>, Scott, <i>altering Hogg&rsquo;s copy</i>,
makes Douglas swear &ldquo;By the might of Our Ladye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a question of opinion; but I do think that if Scott were
merely paraphrasing and pirating Satchells, he could not have
helped putting into his version the Catholic, &ldquo;&lsquo;By
the cross of my sword,&rsquo; then Willy said,&rdquo; as given by
Satchells.&nbsp; To do this was safe, as Scott had said that
Satchells does pirate ballads.&nbsp; On the other hand,
Satchells, composing in black 1688, when Catholicism had been
stamped out on the <i>Scottish Border</i>, was not apt to invent
&ldquo;By the cross of my sword.&rdquo;&nbsp; It <i>looks</i>
like Scott&rsquo;s work, for he, of course, knew how Catholicism
lingered among the spears of Bothwell, himself a Catholic, in
1596.&nbsp; But it is <i>not</i> Scott&rsquo;s work, it is in
Satchells.&nbsp; In both Satchells and the ballad, news comes to
Buccleuch.&nbsp; Here Satchells again balladises&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is that way?&rdquo; Buckcleugh did
say;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord Scrope must understand<br />
That he has not only done me wrong<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But my Sovereign, James of Scotland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Sovereign Lord, King of Scotland,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinks not his cousin Queen,<br />
Will offer to invade his land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Without leave asked and gi&rsquo;en.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not see how Satchells could either invent or glean from
tradition the gist of Buccleuch&rsquo;s diplomatic remonstrances,
first with Salkeld, for Scrope was absent at the time of
Willie&rsquo;s capture, then with Scrope.&nbsp; Buccleuch, in
fact, wrote that the taking of Willie was &ldquo;to the touch of
the King,&rdquo; a stain on his honour, says a contemporary
manuscript. <a name="citation135a"></a><a href="#footnote135a"
class="citation">[135a]</a></p>
<p>In a <i>contemporary</i> ballad, a kind of rhymed news-sheet,
the facts would be known and reported.&nbsp; But at this point
(at Buccleuch&rsquo;s reception of the news of Kinmont), Scott is
perhaps overmastered by his opportunity, and, I think, himself
composes stanzas ix., x., xi., xii.</p>
<blockquote><p>O is my basnet a widow&rsquo;s curch?<br />
Or my lance a wand o&rsquo; the willow tree?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and so on.&nbsp; Child and Mr. Henderson are of the same
opinion; but it is only sense of style that guides us in such a
matter, nor can I give other grounds for supposing that the
original ballad appears again in stanza xiii.</p>
<blockquote><p>O were there war between the lands,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As well I wot that there is none,<br />
I would slight Carlisle castle high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tho&rsquo; it were built o&rsquo; marble stone!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thence, I think, the original ballad (doubtless made
&ldquo;harmonious,&rdquo; as Hogg put it) ran into stanza xxxi.,
where Scott probably introduced the Elliot tune (if it be
ancient)&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>O wha dare meddle wi&rsquo; me?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Satchells next, through a hundred and forty lines, describes
Buccleuch&rsquo;s correspondence with Scrope, his counsels with
his clansmen, and gives all their names and estates, with remarks
on their relationships.&nbsp; He thinks himself a historian and a
genealogist.&nbsp; The stuff is partly in prose lines, partly in
rhymed couplets of various lengths.&nbsp; There are two or three
more or less ballad-like stanzas at the beginning, but they are
too bad for any author but Satchells.</p>
<p>Scott&rsquo;s ballad &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; all that, omits even
what Satchells gives&mdash;mentions of Harden, and goes on
(xv.)&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>He has called him forty marchmen bauld,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I trow they were of his own name.<br />
Except Sir Gilbert Elliot called<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Laird of Stubs, I mean the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I would stake a large sum that Sir Walter never wrote that
&ldquo;stall-copy&rdquo; stanza!&nbsp; Colonel Elliot replies
that I have said the ballad-faker should avoid being too
poetical.&nbsp; The ballad-faker <i>should</i> shun being too
poetical, as he would shun kippered sturgeon; but Scott did not
know this, nor did Hogg.&nbsp; We can always track them by their
too decorative, too literary interpolations.&nbsp; On this I lay
much stress.</p>
<p>The ballad next gives (xvi.&ndash;xxv.) the spirited stanzas
on the ride to the Border&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>There were five and five before them a&rsquo;,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wi&rsquo; hunting horns and bugles bright;<br />
And five and five came wi&rsquo; Buccleuch,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Warden&rsquo;s men arrayed for fight.</p>
<p>And five and five like a mason gang,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That carried the ladders lang and hie;<br />
And five and five like broken men,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And so they reached the Woodhouselee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;a house in Scotland, within &ldquo;a lang mile&rdquo;
of Netherby, in England, the seat of the Grahams, who were
partial, for private reasons, to the Scottish cause.&nbsp; They
were at deadly feud with Thomas Musgrave, Captain of Bewcastle,
and Willie had married a Graham.</p>
<p>Now in my opinion, up to stanza xxvi., all the evasive answers
given to Salkeld by each gang, till Dicky o&rsquo; Dryhope (a
real person) replies with a spear-thrust&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For never a word o&rsquo; lear had
he,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>are not an invention of Scott&rsquo;s (who knew that Salkeld
was not met and slain), but a fantasy of the original
ballad.&nbsp; Here I have only familiarity with the romantic
perversion of facts that marks all ballads on historical themes
to guide me.</p>
<p>Salkeld is met&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As we crossed the Batable land,<br />
When to the English side we held.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ballad does not specify the crossing of Esk, nor say that
Salkeld was on the English side; nor is there any blunder in the
reply of the &ldquo;mason gang&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We gang to harry a corbie&rsquo;s nest,<br
/>
That wons not far frae Woodhouselee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether on English or Scottish soil the masons say not, and
their pretence is derisive, bitterly ironical.</p>
<p>Colonel Elliot makes much of the absence of mention of the
Esk, and says &ldquo;it is <i>after</i> they are in England that
the false reports are spread.&rdquo; <a
name="citation139a"></a><a href="#footnote139a"
class="citation">[139a]</a>&nbsp; But the ballad does not say
so&mdash;read it!&nbsp; All passes with judicious vagueness.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As we crossed the Batable land,<br />
When to the English side we held.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Satchells knows that the ladders were made at Woodhouselee; it
took till nightfall to finish them.&nbsp; The ballad, swift and
poetical, takes the ladders for granted&mdash;as a matter of
fact, chronicled in the dispatches, the Grahams of Netherby
harboured Buccleuch: Netherby was his base.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could nought have done that matter without great
friendship of the Grames of Eske,&rdquo; wrote Buccleuch, in a
letter which Scrope intercepted. <a name="citation139b"></a><a
href="#footnote139b" class="citation">[139b]</a></p>
<p>In Satchells, Buccleuch leaves half his men at the
&ldquo;Stonish bank&rdquo; (Staneshaw bank) &ldquo;<i>for fear
they had made noise or din</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; An old soldier
should have known better, and the ballad (his probable
half-remembered source here) <i>does</i> know better&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And there the laird garr&rsquo;d leave our
<i>steeds</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For fear that they should stamp and nie,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and alarm the castle garrison.&nbsp; Each man of the post on
the ford would hold two horses, and also keep the ford open for
the retreat of the advanced party.&nbsp; The ballad gives the
probable version; Satchells, when offering as a reason for
leaving half the force, lest they should make &ldquo;noise or
din,&rdquo; is maundering.&nbsp; Colonel Elliot does not seem to
perceive this obvious fact, though he does perceive
Buccleuch&rsquo;s motive for dividing his force,
&ldquo;presumably with the object of protecting his line of
retreat,&rdquo; and also to keep the horses out of earshot, as
the ballad says. <a name="citation140a"></a><a
href="#footnote140a" class="citation">[140a]</a></p>
<p>In Satchells the river is &ldquo;in no great
rage.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the ballad it is &ldquo;great and meikle
o&rsquo; spait.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it really was so.&nbsp; The MS.
already cited, which Scott had not seen when he published the
song, says that Buccleuch arrived at the &ldquo;Stoniebank
beneath Carleile brig, the water being at the tyme, through
raines that had fallen, weill thick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Scott&rsquo;s <i>original</i> this river, he says, was the
Esk, in Satchells it is the Eden, and Scott says he made this
necessary correction in the ballad.&nbsp; In Satchells the
storming party</p>
<blockquote><p>Broke a sheet of leid on the castle top.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the ballad they</p>
<blockquote><p>Cut a hole through a sheet o&rsquo; lead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both stories are erroneous; the ladders were too short; the
rescuers broke into a postern door.&nbsp; Scrope told this to his
Government on the day after the deed, 14th April. <a
name="citation140b"></a><a href="#footnote140b"
class="citation">[140b]</a></p>
<p>In xxxi. the ballad makes Buccleuch sound trumpets when the
castle-roof was scaled; in fact it was not scaled.&nbsp; The
ladders were too short, and the Scots broke in a postern
door.&nbsp; The Warden&rsquo;s trumpet blew &ldquo;O wha dare
meddle wi&rsquo; me,&rdquo; and here, as has been said, I think
Scott is the author.&nbsp; Here Colonel Elliot enters into
learning about &ldquo;Wha dare meddle wi&rsquo; me?&rdquo; a
&ldquo;Liddesdale tune,&rdquo; and in the poem an adaptation, by
Scott, of Satchells&rsquo; &ldquo;the trumpets sounded
&lsquo;Come if ye dare.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Satchells makes the trumpets sound when the rescuers bring
Kinmont Willie to the castle-top on the ladder (which they did
not), and again when the rescuers reach the ground by the
ladder.&nbsp; They made no use at all of the ladders, which were
too short, and Willie, says the ballad, lay &ldquo;in the
<i>lower</i> prison.&rdquo;&nbsp; They came in and went out by a
door; but the trumpets are not apocryphal.&nbsp; They, and the
shortness of the ladders, are mentioned in a MS. quoted by Scott,
and in Birrell&rsquo;s contemporary <i>Diary</i>, i. p. 57.&nbsp;
In the MS. Buccleuch causes the trumpets to be sounded from
below, by a detachment &ldquo;in the plain field,&rdquo; securing
the retreat.&nbsp; His motive is to encourage his party,
&ldquo;and to terrify both castle and town by imagination of a
greater force.&rdquo;&nbsp; Buccleuch again &ldquo;sounds up his
trumpet before taking the river,&rdquo; in the MS. Colonel Elliot
may claim stanza xxxi. for Scott, and also the tune &ldquo;Wha
dare meddle wi&rsquo; me?&rdquo; he may even claim here a
suggestion from Satchells&rsquo; &ldquo;Come if ye
dare.&rdquo;&nbsp; Colonel Elliot says that no tune of this title
ever existed, a thing not easy to prove. <a
name="citation142a"></a><a href="#footnote142a"
class="citation">[142a]</a></p>
<p>In the conclusion, with differences, there are resemblances in
the ballad and Satchells.&nbsp; Colonel Elliot goes into them
very minutely.&nbsp; For example, he says that Kinmont is
&ldquo;made to ride off; not on horseback, but on Red
Rowan&rsquo;s back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ballad says not a word to that effect.&nbsp;
Kinmont&rsquo;s speech about Red Rowan as &ldquo;a rough
beast&rdquo; to ride, is made immediately after the stanza,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Then shoulder high, with shout and cry,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We bore him down the ladder lang;<br />
At every stride Red Rowan made,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I wot the Kinmont&rsquo;s airns played clang.&rdquo;
<a name="citation142b"></a><a href="#footnote142b"
class="citation">[142b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this verse Kinmont makes his speech
(xl.&ndash;xli.).&nbsp; But if he <i>did</i> ride on Red
Rowan&rsquo;s back to Staneshaw bank, it was the best thing that
a heavily ironed man could do.&nbsp; In the ballad (xxvii.) no
horses of the party were waiting at the castle, <i>all</i> horses
were left behind at Staneshaw bank (Satchells brings horses, or
at least a horse for Willie, to the castle).&nbsp; On what could
Willie &ldquo;ride off,&rdquo; except on Red Rowan? <a
name="citation142c"></a><a href="#footnote142c"
class="citation">[142c]</a></p>
<p>Stanzas xxxv., xxxvi. and xliv. are related, we have seen, to
passages in <i>Jock o&rsquo; the Side</i> and <i>Archie o&rsquo;
Cafield</i>, but ballads, like Homer, employ the same
formul&aelig; to describe the same circumstances: a note of
archaism, as in Gaelic poetic passages in
<i>M&auml;rchen</i>.</p>
<p>I do not pretend always to know how far Scott kept and emended
old stanzas mangled by reciters: there are places in which I am
quite at a loss to tell whether he is &ldquo;making&rdquo; or
copying.</p>
<p>I incline to hold that Satchells was occasionally reminiscent
of a ballad for the reasons and traces given, and I think that
Scott when his and Satchells&rsquo; versions coincide, did not
borrow direct from Satchells, but that both men had a ballad
source.</p>
<p>That ballad was later than the popular belief, held by
Satchells, that Gilbert Elliot was at the time (1596) laird of
Stobs, which he did not acquire till after the Union (1603), and
that he (the only man not a Scot, says Satchells, wrongly) rode
with Buccleuch.&nbsp; Elliot is not accused of doing so in
Scrope&rsquo;s dispatches, but he may have come as far as
Staneshaw bank, where half the company were left behind, says
Satchells, with the horses, which were also left, says the
ballad.&nbsp; In that case Elliot would not be observed in or
near the Castle.&nbsp; Yet it may have been known in Scotland
that he was of the party.</p>
<p>He was, as Satchells says, a cousin, he was also a friend of
Buccleuch&rsquo;s, and he may conceivably have taken a part in
this glorious adventure, though he could not, <i>at the
moment</i>, be called laird of Stobs.&nbsp; Were I an Elliot,
this opinion would be welcome to me!&nbsp; Really, Salkeld was in
a good position to know whether Elliot rode with Buccleuch or
not.</p>
<p>The whole question is not one on which I can speak
dogmatically.&nbsp; A person who suspects Scott intensely may
believe that there were no ballad fragments of Kinmont in his
possession.&nbsp; The person who, like myself, thinks Satchells,
with his &ldquo;It fell about the Martinmas,&rdquo; knew a ballad
vaguely, believes that Satchells <i>had</i> some ballad sources
bemuddled in his old memory.</p>
<p>A person who cannot conceive that Scott wrote</p>
<blockquote><p>Except Sir Gilbert Elliot, called<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The laird of Stobs, I mean the same,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>will hold that Scott knew some ballad fragments, <i>disjecta
membra</i>.&nbsp; But I quite agree with Colonel Elliot, that the
ballad, <i>as it stands</i> (with the exception, to my mind, of
some thirty stanzas, themselves emended), &ldquo;belongs to the
early nineteenth century, not to the early
seventeenth.&rdquo;&nbsp; The time for supposing the poem, <i>as
it stands</i>, to be &ldquo;saturated with the folk-spirit&rdquo;
all through is past; the poem is far too much contaminated by the
genius of Scott itself; like Burns&rsquo; transfiguration of
&ldquo;the folk-spirit&rdquo; at its best.</p>
<p>Near the beginning of this paper I said, in answer to a
question of Colonel Elliot&rsquo;s, that I myself was the person
who had suspected Scott of composing the whole of <i>Kinmont
Willie</i>, and I have given my reasons for not remaining
constant to my suspicions.&nbsp; But in a work which Colonel
Elliot quotes, the abridged edition of Child&rsquo;s great book
by Mrs. Child-Sargent and Professor Kittredge (1905), the learned
professor writes, &ldquo;<i>Kinmont Willie</i> is under vehement
suspicion of being the work of Sir Walter Scott.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Kittredge&rsquo;s entire passage on the matter is worth
quoting.&nbsp; He first says&mdash;&ldquo;The traditional ballad
appears to be inimitable by any person of literary
cultivation,&rdquo; &ldquo;the efforts of poets and
poetasters&rdquo; end in &ldquo;invariable failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not think that they need end in failure except for one
reason.&nbsp; The poet or poetaster cannot, now, except by flat
lying and laborious forgery of old papers, produce any
documentary evidence to prove the <i>authenticity</i> of his
attempt at imitation.&nbsp; Without documentary evidence of
antiquity, no critic can approach the imitation except in a
spirit of determined scepticism.&nbsp; He knows, certainly, that
the ballad is modern, and, knowing that, he easily finds proofs
of modernism even where they do not really exist.&nbsp; I am
convinced that to imitate a ballad that would, except for the
lack of documentary evidence, beguile the expert, is perfectly
feasible.&nbsp; I even venture to offer examples of my own
manufacture at the close of this volume.&nbsp; I can find nothing
suspicious in them, except the deliberate insertion of
formul&aelig; which occur in genuine ballads.&nbsp; Such
<i>wiederholungen</i> are not reasons for rejection, in my
opinion; but they are <i>suspect</i> with people who do not
understand that they are a natural and necessary feature of
archaic poetry, and this fact Mr. Kittredge does understand.</p>
<p>Mr. Kittredge speaks of Sir Walter&rsquo;s unique success with
<i>Kinmont Willie</i>; but is Sir Walter successful?&nbsp; Some
of his stanzas I, for one, can hardly accept, even as emended
traditional verses.</p>
<p>Mr. Kittredge writes&mdash;&ldquo;Sir Walter&rsquo;s success,
however, in a special kind of balladry for which he was better
adapted by nature and habit of mind than for any other, would
only emphasise the universal failure.&nbsp; And it must not be
forgotten that <i>Kinmont Willie</i>, if it be Scott&rsquo;s
work, is not made out of whole cloth; it is a working over of one
of the best traditional ballads known (<i>Jock o&rsquo; the
Side</i>), with the intention of fitting it to an historical
exploit of Buccleuch.&nbsp; Further, the subject itself was of
such a nature that it might well have been celebrated in a
ballad,&mdash;indeed, one is tempted to say, it must have been so
celebrated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a doubt of <i>that</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, finally, Sir Walter Scott felt towards &lsquo;the
Kinmont&rsquo; and &lsquo;the bold Buccleuch&rsquo; precisely as
the moss-trooping author of such a ballad would have felt.&nbsp;
For once, then, the miraculous happened. . . . &rdquo; <a
name="citation146a"></a><a href="#footnote146a"
class="citation">[146a]</a>&nbsp; Or did not happen, for the
exception is &ldquo;solitary though doubtful,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;under vehement suspicion.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Mr. Kittredge
must remember that no known Scottish ballad &ldquo;is made out of
whole cloth.&rdquo;&nbsp; All have, in various degrees, the
successive modifications wrought by centuries of oral tradition,
itself, in some cases, modifying a much modified printed
&ldquo;stall-copy&rdquo; or &ldquo;broadside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Take <i>Jock o&rsquo; the Side</i>.&nbsp; The oldest version
is in the Percy MS. <a name="citation147a"></a><a
href="#footnote147a" class="citation">[147a]</a>&nbsp; As Mr.
Henderson says, &ldquo;it contains many evident
corruptions,&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Jock on his lively bay, Wat&rsquo;s on his
white horse behind.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is an example of what the original author could not have
written!</p>
<p>We do not know how good <i>Jock</i> was when he left his
poet&rsquo;s hands; and Scott has not touched him up.&nbsp; We
cannot estimate the original excellence of any traditional poem
by the state in which we find it,</p>
<blockquote><p>Corrupt by every beggar-man,<br />
And soiled by all ignoble use.</p>

href="#footnote148a" class="citation">[148a]</a>&nbsp; Thirdly,
Scott, it is suggested, knew only what I call &ldquo;the Elliot
version&rdquo; of <i>Jamie Telfer</i>, perverted that by
transposing the <i>r&ocirc;les</i> of Buccleuch and Stobs, and
added picturesque stanzas in glorification of his ancestor, Wat
of Harden.&nbsp; Fourthly, he is suspected of &ldquo;writing the
whole ballad&rdquo; of <i>Kinmont Willie</i>, &ldquo;from
beginning to end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of these four charges the first, and most disastrous, we have
absolutely disproved.&nbsp; Scott did not write one verse of the
<i>Auld Maitland</i>; he edited it with unusual scrupulosity, for
he had but one copy, and an almost identical recitation.&nbsp; He
could not &ldquo;eke and alter&rdquo; by adding verses from other
texts, as he did in <i>Otterburne</i>.</p>
<p>Secondly, Scott did not make up <i>Otterburne</i> in the way
suggested by his critic.&nbsp; He took Hogg&rsquo;s MS., and I
have shown minutely what that MS. was, and he edited it in
accordance with his professed principles.&nbsp; He made &ldquo;a
standard text.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is only to be regretted that Hogg
did not take down <i>verbatim</i> the words of his two reciters
and narrators, and that Scott did not publish Hogg&rsquo;s
version, with his letter, in his notes; but that was not his
method, nor the method of his contemporaries.</p>
<p>Thirdly, as to <i>Jamie Telfer</i>, long ago I wrote,
opposite</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The lyart locks of Harden&rsquo;s
hair,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>aut Jacobus aut Diabolus</i>, meaning that either James
Hogg or the devil composed that stanza.&nbsp; I was wrong.&nbsp;
Hogg had nothing to do with it; on internal evidence Scott was
the maker.&nbsp; But that he transposed the Scott and Elliot
<i>r&ocirc;les</i> is incapable of proof; and I have shown that
such perversions were made in very early times, where national,
not clan prejudices were concerned.&nbsp; I have also shown that
Scott&rsquo;s version contains matter not in the Elliot version,
matter injurious to the poem, as in one stanza, certainly not
composed by himself, the stanza being an inappropriate stray
formula from other ballads.&nbsp; But, in the absence of
manuscript materials I can only produce presumptions, not
proofs.</p>
<p>Lastly, <i>Kinmont Willie</i>, and Scott&rsquo;s share in it,
is matter of presumption, not of proof.&nbsp; He had been in
quest of the ballad, as we know from his list of
<i>desiderata</i>; he says that what he got was
&ldquo;mangled&rdquo; by reciters, and that, in what he got, one
river was mentioned where topography requires another.&nbsp; He
also admits that, in the three ballads of rescues, he placed
passages where they had most poetical appropriateness.&nbsp; My
arguments to show that Satchells had memory of a Kinmont ballad
will doubtless appeal with more or less success, or with none, to
different students.&nbsp; That an indefinite quantity of the
ballad, and improvements on the rest, are Scott&rsquo;s, I cannot
doubt, from evidence of style.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Walter Scott it is impossible to assail, however
much the scholarly conscience may disapprove,&rdquo; says Mr.
Kittredge. <a name="citation150a"></a><a href="#footnote150a"
class="citation">[150a]</a>&nbsp; Not much is to be taken by
assailing him!&nbsp; &ldquo;Business first, pleasure
afterwards,&rdquo; as, according to Sam Weller, Richard III.
said, when he killed Henry VI. before smothering the princes in
the Tower.&nbsp; I proceed to pleasure in the way of presenting
imitations of &ldquo;the traditional ballad&rdquo; which
&ldquo;appears to be inimitable by any person of literary
cultivation,&rdquo; according to Mr. Kittredge.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Imitations of Ballads</span></h3>
<p>The three following ballads are exhibited in connection with
Mr. Kittredge&rsquo;s opinion that neither poet nor poetaster can
imitate, to-day, the traditional ballad.&nbsp; Of course, not one
of my three could now take in an expert, for he would ask for
documentary evidence of their antiquity.&nbsp; But I doubt if Mr.
Kittredge can find any points in my three imitations which
infallibly betray their modernity.</p>
<p>The first, <i>Simmy o&rsquo; Whythaugh</i>, is based on facts
in the Border despatches.&nbsp; Historically the attempt to
escape from York Castle failed; after the prisoners had got out
they were recaptured.</p>
<p>The second ballad, <i>The Young Ruthven</i>, gives the
traditional view of the slaying of the Ruthvens in their own
house in Perth, on 5th August 1600.</p>
<p>The third, <i>The Dead Man&rsquo;s Dance</i>, combines the
horror of the ballads of <i>Lizzy Wan</i> and <i>The Bonny
Hind</i>, with that of the Romaic ballad, in English, <i>The
Suffolk Miracle</i> (Child, No. 272).</p>
<h4>I&mdash;SIMMY O&rsquo; WHYTHAUGH</h4>
<p class="poetry">O, will ye hear o&rsquo; the Bishop o&rsquo;
York,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O, will ye hear o&rsquo; the Armstrongs true,<br />
How they hae broken the Bishop&rsquo;s castle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And carried himsel&rsquo; to the bauld
Buccleuch?</p>
<p class="poetry">They were but four o&rsquo; the Lariston

&nbsp;&nbsp; They were but four o&rsquo; the Armstrong name,<br

<p class="poetry">They had done nae man an injury,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They had na robbed, they had na slain,<br />
In pledge were they laid for the Border peace,<br />

<p class="poetry">Then Simmy has gi&rsquo;en him his seal and

&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Laird o&rsquo; Cessford has ridden
he&mdash;<br />
I trow when Sir Robert had heard his word<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The tear it stood in Sir Robert&rsquo;s

I trow I&rsquo;ll spare neither life nor gear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or ever I live to see that day!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Gar bring up my horses,&rdquo; Sir
Robert he said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I bid ye bring them by three and three,<br />
And ane by ane at St. George&rsquo;s close,<br />

<p class="poetry">Oh, some rade like corn-cadger men,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And some like merchants o&rsquo; linen and hose;<br

They slept by day and they rade by nicht,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till they a&rsquo; convened at St. George&rsquo;s

<p class="poetry">Ilka mounted man led a bridded mear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I trow they had won on the English way;<br />
Ilka belted man had a brace o&rsquo; swords,<br />

<p class="poetry">Then Simmy he heard a hoolet cry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the chamber strang wi&rsquo; never a licht;<br />
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a hoolet, I ken,&rdquo; did Simmy say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;And I trow that Teviotdale&rsquo;s here the

<p class="poetry">They hae grippit a bench was clamped wi&rsquo;
steel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wi&rsquo; micht and main hae they wrought, they

They hae burst it free, and rammed wi&rsquo; the bench,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till they brake a hole in the chamber door.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Lift strae frae the beds,&rdquo; did
Simmy say;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the gallery window Simmy sped,<br />
He has set his strength to a window bar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bursten it out o&rsquo; the binding lead.</p>
<p class="poetry">He has bursten the bolts o&rsquo; the Elliot

&nbsp;&nbsp; Out ower the window the strae cast he,<br />
For they bid to loup frae the window high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And licht on the strae their fa&rsquo; would be.</p>

&ldquo;Fu&rsquo; weary am I o&rsquo; your bread and water,<br />

He has cast him doon frae the window high,<br />

<p class="poetry">They rade by nicht and they slept by day;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I wot they rade by an unkenned track;<br />
&ldquo;The Bishop was licht as a flea,&rdquo; said Sim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Or ever we cam&rsquo; to the Liddel
rack.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then &ldquo;Welcome, my Lord,&rdquo; did Simmy
say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll win to Whythaugh afore we

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
